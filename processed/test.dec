Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
You always been this selfish?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Why?
As in...
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No! I just wanted
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Will Bogey get bent?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Your sister here?
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Nope - just came by to chat
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Does it matter?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, right.  Friday.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Hi
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
You know who The Raincoats are?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Who?
What?
No, you weren't
The duck?
I know the porn career's a lie.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Enough!
I thought you were punishing me.
Funny.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Oh yeah.
Yeah...
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
We're your guys.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Call them.
Look out of that window.
Island.  Far.
Chief says...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
New worlds create new people.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
God be with us admiral.
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
And who would you think of, for such a task?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Divorced.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Yeah.  This way.
What about back home?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Go on.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Okay.  But not water sports.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Better than one.
I'm on duty.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Answer it.
Yeah.
See you later.  Good luck.
Not what.  Who.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Two weeks holiday.
He doesn't speak English.
I want to document my trip to America.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Cut!
Be quiet.  Watch.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
As a plumber?!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
I want to hear everything he said.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
How long they been livin' here?
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Really.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
That's true.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
What is it, Hal?
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
Certainly.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
I will if I can, Frank.
That's true.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
How about chargin' the battery?
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
What's the matter with my place?
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Jesus.
Shit.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
So you took the rest of the night off...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
How did they get away?
You couldn't get to him?
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Yeah.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Who gives a fuck what you think?
What'd you do?
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Jack, are you okay?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Shut up.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
First, the money.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
Don't mess with me. How much?
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
They are robots!
The girl?
You noticed...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
She's an exception..
It means, "Never without my permission".
What kind of mission?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Like shit.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
You little sleaze bag!
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
To save the world.
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
You're the only one left alive...
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Protect life... Until death.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I want to sleep... forever...
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Have you identified it?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Perfect, Mr. President.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Amen..
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
I love you.
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
What you see is what I got, mister.
We can do that.
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Any good?
I know what you did.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
It was a lot of fucking money.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Stop talking.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
You'll get it when we get there.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Three, four years.
Max.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Twenty-five.
I don't know, where are yours?
You're learning.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Thank you.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Yes, but...
No.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
I didn't mean to...
No.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
What?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
It was Freddy.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You had a nasty bump.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
It's just across the park.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Stick around, please?
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Huh?
So?
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
We hope!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
There's got to be an explanation!
Take a look.
Minus three.
You don't believe me?
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You might not kill it.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Sun's gettin high.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Piece of fucking cake.
No.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Okay, let's go home, then.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
I'm sorry about what I said.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Hold on!
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Marg! You got orders!
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
You remember Margie Fogg?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
She's coming.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
Did we warn them off?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
Dead.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
What do you want with us?
That was war.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Gravity.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
We're under attack.
Two... THREE. GO!
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I might still have a few chips left.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Dunn.
Who's that, Ted?
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Elaine, what's going on?
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Don't be too long.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
That's not possible.
Request; life support systems check.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
No. I'm all alone.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
But if you'll just give me...
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Yes?
The gear is down.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
He didn't recognize me.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Here?
Do it!
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Why'd I do what?
At the end of the bar.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
This is mole.  It's good.
My wife?  She worries about me.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
We all did.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Departmental policy.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
That's right.
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Sorry to disappoint you.
Proceed inside.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
They're but off!  Do something!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
About seventeen days.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
No.  Have you?
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Uh, what's next?
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Yes.  A little girl.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Meaning you didn't like it.
What??
Sir -
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Fartsbishop!
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Of course.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Tell them to go!
No!
Wolfi!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
I don't know.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Oh?
Ah-ha.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Am I not welcome?
How is your financial situation?
Pupils?
No one calls you that.
Good morning, sir.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Not that I've seen.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Yes what?
Are you sure it's an opera?
Are you Herr Mozart?
German!
Wolfi!
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What?
Madame.
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Really?
How could I not?
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
How could it not, Excellency?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
This is only a vaudeville.
What?
Show me.
Do you have it?
What for?
Certainly, Herr Director.
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
A little modesty would suit you better.
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
So?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Yes.
But not his body.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
But he's all right?
He said 'Jack'.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Warn him?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Shall I send a car?
Tea would be nice.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
How is that?
I was. What are you reading?
How old are you?
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
That's easy enough.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Your dead friend Jack?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
The bedroom.
Of course.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
No!
I looked.
You did, did you?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
That's very funny, that is.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Lunatic?
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
You're not having a good time are you?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
It's a five-pointed star.
Do you think it's a dog?
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Nurse!
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
What do you think?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Why don't we ask him?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
No.
You here again? What do you want?
About twenty-four thousand.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
You understand?
Fifty thousand dollars!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
A misunderstood bachelor.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Now don't you worry about it.
Good morning.
Yes, sir.
But I haven't . . .
Yes.
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
Yes, sir.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Mine too?
No.
With what?
Yes.
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Dude Finlay?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
It couldn't have been earlier?
I'm okay, Matt.
Jim Younger, I told you--
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
The Army can hang him.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
How?
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
What's going on?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
Perfect, Cole.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Sure, cousin.
That's it.
I'm out.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Both would be nice.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Ah.
Cole, he didn't mean that.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Then why can't I go in there?
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
You are a charmer.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
The posters?
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
They're making him a hero now.
Nuh-huh ...
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Let the law --
"Hmm" what?
Yes ma'am.
You are a hell of a woman.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Mmm.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Thank you.
You been with a girl ever?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Not at all.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
They had to be dealt with!
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
You like it there, don't you?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
This is Dorsia?
Is it a what?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Do...what.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Good coloring.
The message you left.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Maybe it's just the light.
New card. What do you think?
Leaving what?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Negative. Cancel it.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Jean-I'm not-
Well...
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Hello 
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Uh huh?
Paul Owen.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Understandable.  Lime?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Thanks.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Marcus?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Yeah, well, you're late.
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Yes, it is.
'Gonna wait outside.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
You think I don't know that?
Nothing.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Milo, you --
Just shut up?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Is it your dish?
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
'Sorry about the late notice...
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Longitude 109 --
Gary?
I mean, it's your life.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
The Day Care?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
You mean -- break in?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Be careful.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
Oh, yes you are.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Not in the Nineties.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Dr. Evil?
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
We don't judge here.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
Red ...
Black...
... death ...
Three days.
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
As you see.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
This isn't a game.
After the cold war ...
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
You killed my husband.
'Our revels now are ended.'
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
I'll never marry you.
Whereas you are.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Because you always obey orders ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Not for a moment.
As far as you trust me.
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
You didn't tell her?
Have we been invited?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Have you any place in mind?
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Impossible.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Debbie's marrying Rick.
...Really?
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Oh, come on, just a little.
The best.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Sure have...
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
No, Cole, I...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
What are we having?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I can't sleep.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
I am committed. I love you.
Ilene, Rick promised...
What's going on?
I didn't know you were into that.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
It's Bullwinkle.
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
No. Let's at least finish the set.
My gift to you.
So long, Father.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
Who's your friend?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Be gentle.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
Not likely.
That was never proved.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
This?
Yeah... too bright...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Thanks for the insight.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
You're selling dad's boat?
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Everybody did.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
How's it going?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Homey.
I wanted to be a good one.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
No.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
You look like... Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He treats you okay?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
There's something else kinda interesting...
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
"Don?"
Who?
Yes.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
How 'bout...
YEAH!
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
What's your name?
We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
I'm tired of waiting.
We was coming to see you.
I'm sorry I'm late.
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
I'm wid it.
Yep, you guessed it.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
I want to speak with you.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Where do you go from here?
Nobody told me anything.
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
This is Cheeba.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
I thought it was appropiate.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Yes he did.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. 
To come back to our roots.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I thought you got rid of...
...like grits and butter...
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Oh you do, huh?
You leave something out?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
How so?
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Old fool!
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Good night, my little darling.
Yes, he's fine.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Can anybody hear me!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
We don't know. West is dead.
What do you mean, alone?
What do you like then?
Tell me about them.
He's lying.
I'm serious --
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Yeah.
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
Then who did?
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
My heart weeps.
Well?
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Not for me.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Home, I'm done.
What the hell are you talking about --
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
Watch me.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Buttfucks the cabin?
I should probably write that down.
The faggot speaks.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
He wanted more than that.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
The fuck are you talking about --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Yes!
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
What did she look like?
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
No, I understand.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
What did he say?
You owe me three-fifty.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I wasn't expecting you.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Yes.
But it's romantic.
Do you love him?
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
That's okay?
We'll stop then.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Name it.
Ch...
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Right.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
No, no...
I...
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry?
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
What's wrong?
They go.
You don't understand anything.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
In the world.
Yes.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
You are throwing me out.
You don't have to say anything
I wasn't saying anything.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Laugh it up.
Please. Why not?
Goodbye.
Please.
Tell me about it.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
You take her to a doctor?
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
I keep the heat on.
Better'n me?
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Wait. He left.
Don't need none.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
Uh-uh.
You drink whiskey?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
I didn't start this, R.L.
Or what?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae don't do this now...
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
Yeah, I do.
Yeah.
I just wanted some make-up.
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Let go...
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Let's grab some food.
Maybe we should bail?
I don't think he'd feel it.
Connie...
You'll take care of that.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
A snitch?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I couldn't tell.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
He drinks.
I don't remember saying yes.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Yeah.
He was my partner.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
You're foreigners.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
I want him.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
Also extraordinary things.
Like...
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
You didn't like her!?
Got it.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Okay, but...
I know all that.
Not if it works.
Shot of vodka, please.
Sorry.
Money?
You sure?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What's suck night?
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
I'm sorry.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Please.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
But how come I'd be there?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I don't have one.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
You scared me.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
You like it?
Your mom was a dancer?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Come where?
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
What?!
Do ya?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Here, pick these up!
Again.
Heck, no!  What?!
Take it. damn it!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Two weeks.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
I thought only hookers drank those things.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
That's boring!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I'm sorry.
Sing it to me.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
What's baseball?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Blow out the candles!
No kidding!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
That's what everybody believes?
Not particularly.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Russia.
Juneau.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Does that work?
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
The sky!!!
I do alright.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
Are you in trouble, son?!
What?
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
I told you! I've got everything!
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Hi.
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
I don't believe it!
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
--do as I say!
What can I offer you, Eve?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
What?!
We'll find him.
Yeah! That's thinking.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Why do you do it?
It's blue. Blue velvet.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Yes sir.
Not yet.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
No. Come on.
Do you know?
No.
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Who's it, you mean.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Dorothy. No!
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
You want to see him too, right?
Go where?
Nothing.
Mom.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Alright.
Yeah. okay.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Am I bothering you?
Yes.
That's too bad.
Yeah. Good bye.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You've got a point there.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
This is not my usual Friday night!
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Are you sure?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Goodnight.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
Sandy?
Just for him?
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
I need Il Duce.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
This is a six-shooter.
What are you saying?
You think they sold me out? No way.
What happened?
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Well, I didn't but...
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
And he is one smart man.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The Sicilians.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Sweet-n-low!
Shit! Shit!
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Well, what'ya do?
Y-Yes my son.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
What does Starsky say?
She's an attractive older woman.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Yeah, I heard that.
Eight dollars.
You think we're going to be chased?
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Yeah.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
No. We didn't.
Bob?
Don't worry about it, Bob.
You were asleep.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
Let me feel that.
Get out of the way.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
OK. Mark that down.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Yeah. As a girl.
You're all clear.
Roger.
What?
What do you mean?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
What do you mean?
No, that door over there.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
It's an esoteric journey.
Let them fight.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Were you adopted, Bob?
It was stupid.
Dies y nueve.
Like silk?
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
You're Anthony?
What do you mean?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
You're paranoid, Bob.
His name was Swifty?
Did we get it?
So it's my fault?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
That could be anybody's.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
I don't know.
Yes, I do.
Just get in the car, Bob.
What's his name?
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Not bad.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I know it, man. Hang on.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Let's go!
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Where's Applejack?
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Wait a second --
I'm working on it.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
We're just going over a few things.
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Who? Applejack?
Why did he go that way? 
No, my friend knows her.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
Do you know what his budget was?
May I finish?
No good options left?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
It was staged?
Lots of people...
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
But it ends up the same.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
We can't wait to be sure.
What?
-- hang on --
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
You do?
Who is Pamela Landy?
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
Careful...
I'm working on it.
Who's this?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
If you say so.
You mean, did I want a date?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
And what about you, anything?
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
I have ordered conscriptions...
But if we have not caught Wallace --
You may.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Three, maybe more!
A patriot!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
No. He did not.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Humbly, M'lord.
I do not confess.
Thank you for accepting.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Tonight then.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
I need you so much! I love you!
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
...I wouldn't know.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Who would do such a thing?
Exactly.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
How soon?...
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
What the fuck are you doing?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It was a long time ago.
I know, but...
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
I walk differently?
He's a fucking maniac!
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
We'll find out soon enough.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Wow... read something.
Gee, thanks friend.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
You're such a retard!
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Yes, I'll bet.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
Monsieur Rick!
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Come up here a minute.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
We said "no questions."
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
I didn't count the days.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
You can believe that if you want to.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Everything is quite all right.
But what about us?
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Be careful.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes?
Ask me?
-- Yes?
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Of course, I'll be careful.
How do you do?
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I said, ask your wife.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes.
Yes.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
This is hardly the time or the place.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Perhaps.
A leader, like Laszlo?
Find one.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Victor Laszlo?
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
No.
Then don't have a drink.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Just a little something of my own.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Yes, boss.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
Thirsty.
They're harder to do than they look.
Well, I do a little drawing --
You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
He's your cute thing.
And for you --
You did?
Could you watch Jango?
Yes there is.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I would have done the same thing.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
You too.
Anything else?
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
What about the sender?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
It was fifteen minutes late.
But I might not have.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
Forget it.
That's why you're a gambling man.
To Wilson.
What?
No sweat.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Better than I can!
Wally said to say, "Hello."
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
Just a little privacy.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
"...did." Well, okay.
I can't go nowhere.
That's true.
But did you know him?
No. She was an immigrant.
That's why Kong loves her!
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
It's okay--I don't mind.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Where are you going?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
It's all very normal.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
I don't know it.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
I'm happy I amuse you.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
No trouble.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Tough day?
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Isn't it always?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
Let's go, Jake?
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
Eight A.M. flight.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
No thanks. I'm good.
Sure.
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
We're not cops.
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
What do we need another Shill for?
You sure?
That was fucking deep.
The King.
It's not history.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
What do you get out of it?
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm down!
High five.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
I don't know anything about it.
How about five hundred.
All right. As what?
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
I've got something to tell you.
I start Monday week.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Leave it.
Never. Why do you ask?
It's not that.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
Well, thank you anyway.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
That's fine.
You choose.
Then you're not a pro.
I owe a lot of money.
You're serious.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
You did?
Have I?
Some other time.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
Has he?
Give me 365.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Right, that checks out here.
Look, bomb...
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
Hmmm...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Talk to the bomb.
Sir?
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
I'm on a break.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Yeah?
Leave.  Now.
No.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
What?  Where're we going?
Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
I was expecting someone else.
Whoever that is.
The one you're wearing?
Girlfriend?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So what are you gonna do about it?
I'm not a half bad cook.
Bent?
Your basic hodge-podge.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Open it.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
Here's your money.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
A little what?
Not right now?  Okay, when?
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
Right, the big one-oh.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
I'll give it my best shot.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Yeah, a man's drink...
I-I c-can't...
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Uhh... nothing.
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
What?
Look, you can have my wallet...
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
I don't even think you have a gun!
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Donnie.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
You know what? I think that you did it.
You'll know soon enough.
Take it off. I want to see you.
Why do they call you Frank?
Sure.
What makes you think I'm not?
Why is that?
Will you go with me?
I'm going home.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
What?
Infant Memory Generators.
The whole movie. Let's go.
But you're OK?
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yes.
That I did it again.
If God exists?
I think now that he might...
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Who is he going to kill?
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Gerald.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
You can suck a fuck.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
I guess they made him do it.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Kitty...
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
Huh?
I love you much.
I just did.
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
And the bite marks on my ears?
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
So? Be real easy.
Okay?
What?
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Becky was my only shot at state!
Nothin' too showy!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
I will if you shut your piehole.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
"My dear President"...
"My dear President"...
You do and I'll fire you.
Yankee Poodle.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Sure.
Go ahead.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Now -- er --
Why -- why -- of course.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
The king can do no wrong!
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Right... Right.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
Are you comfortable here?
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Alas, no.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
Is he... dying then?
Want to come out?
Thank you... very much.
Yyyess.
Hello...
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Of course! What did you think?
How is your tea, John?
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Yes, John?
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Very smart indeed.
Pardon me?
WELCOME?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
But, Erik...
What d'you mean?
I shouldn't have come.
That I cannot tell you.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
What -- rape?
Why... should YOU care?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
What's it all about?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Row! Row! Row!
Why should WE care?
But you're the Gods!
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
You'll be sucked down too!
What is it?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
What are you talking about?
Can't make enough swords!
You fool!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
You went berserk...
So did my father and his father before him.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Dad!
I hate you! I hate you!
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
Say hi to Naomi.
And I just liked you so much.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
In the room?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
I don't know what that means.
I'm not nuts.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
What?
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Cheers.
You pick it.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Yeah?
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
No.
I don't know.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
I'm right here.
Really? Is he cute?
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Do you remember what we talked about?
But you weren't. I could tell.
Is that what you want?
What if you stay this time?
Tomorrow?
What if?
I just walked in.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I'm like a joke to them.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
Well... I did.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
I miss you.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
I'm glad you called.
Very cool. Trippy.
I know. Anyway --
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
What?
Do you swear you didn't know?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
It's no big deal.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Well, where was Patrick?
That's fine, Stan.
Just wanted to let you know.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Save your breath for the climb.
Clockworks.
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
I don't.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
American Cheese. The king of road food.
For magazines?
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
I don't know anything about it.
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
What about the accumulator...?
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
No.
It gets worse.
Hear what?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
From the Other Place...
Start the countdown.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
There's no one here, Skipper.
What you got, Peters?
Do it.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
If it worked.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Watch me.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
How much oh-two do we have?
Oxygen is not the problem.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Who?
What is it, Starck?
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Blow it up?
Yes.
Keep him talking.
It's cold.
Do they have pressure?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
I'm alright. Please.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
Where do you think? With Sue.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
What do you mean "complete"?
Johnny.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Never better.
Which was?
Passion.
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Sure.
Ben's still out there --
Ben did this.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Arnold. What's happening?
Later.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
What a guy.
Mark is a really nice boy...
I didn't see you this morning.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her name?
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
Really.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
That's me, Merv.
I like sex.
This ain't no cop.
They're fuckin' with us.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Do you think that guy's cute?
You'll always remember your first time.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Not since November.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
I think they're both virgins.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Dartmouth?!
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
All right, the point it is.
We keep them.
You keep them.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Oh. I see.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Anything to drink?
Well, thank you.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
He wanted the pineal gland.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
What?
Jesus! Did I say that?
Damn right!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
You whore!
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
Why what?
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
That's what gives me The Fear.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
What tape?
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
Extract of pineal!
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
No! I swear I'm not!
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Right.
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
We're going to get my little girl.
Upstairs.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
Well, justice is funny.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
Shit!
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Your parents of relation?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
What's going on between you two?
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
No shit.
BONSAI!
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
YOU'LL HIT US!
Wait God-dammit!
I'm fine, I really am.
Right.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
I'm not!
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Get your clothes on, lady --
You're under arrest.
Fired?
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick, we need some time apart --
Dick...
I know you believe that.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Oh, Kurt!
Occupation?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
They'll mend.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
Well? What'd you think?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Harry... I met someone.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Is that why you did it?
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
You're coming.
And?
Whattaya think you're in now?
What a man!
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
No.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
What?
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Then why did you bring them?
You kill me, Mama.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Yes, Mama.
I'm going out!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
But what -- 
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
You're telling me you feel guilty.
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yes.
I was watching.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Friends? Do they live around here?
I see it before me.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
She's not for you.
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
Quite right!
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
Is he not back yet?
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Father's so proud.
And you?
Aye, Captain.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
No. They don't.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
The strain was evident.
You know of it?
Right! Right!
You okay?
Maybe I can help?
You're right. It makes no sense.
Good point.
Where'd you get that stuff?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
That was the telephone.
Good call.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I guess...
I call it my shower dream.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I got to.
Have you ever been there before?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
You're a preacher?
Yes.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
In the Winnebago.
Yep.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
What's in Mexico?
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
-- you got your microwave --
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
What?
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
My shit is together.
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
Oh, really.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Pardon?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
West?
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Uh, question, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am.
What changed?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Do that.
... two... one... MARK!
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Just a coincidence?
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Is this my glory, sir?
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
This has nothing to do with you.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Me?  Why me?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
I don't know, I don't care.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
Not me.  You?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I think you look beautiful.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Maybe half.  Not even.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
That's not right.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
I take it this file is still open.
What?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
This is not the place...
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
Why are you telling this to me?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
I heard something. A squeal.
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
To see if there's a pub.
Oh.  Okay.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Excuse me guys.
Brandon.
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
It's fractured...
Never mind, Fred....
No, no... I'll think on it...
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
You... know us?
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
We're doing episode 31?
But I'm the Commander!
Tell them? About...
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
JASON...
I could have held on to YOU! ...
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Gwen...
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
As you wish.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Get oacK on their tail.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
I?  You all know my history.
While they're strung out?
Yes, general.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
Lafayette will not be happy...
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
Then use rocks!
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
No one knows...
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
They are... friends of Congress.
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
Gag on your own invention, then.
You invented this, this...
What's the difference?
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
Some things must never change.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
I see...
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
So... how many movies you been in?
Your who?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
She's... young.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Tell you what...
I don't believe this.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
What three hundred grand?
Who?
Ray. Look at me.
Look at me, Ray.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
He owes me money.
That's right.
I'm a producer.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
But you work for the casino?
Ever shot anybody.
Really? You ever been arrested?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You're kidding, right?
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
I'm looking at you.
Buddy?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
That's right. Three percent.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
A real bargain.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
Harry -
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Really.
A passenger liner. Over.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Lemme see.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
Wrong. It's Friday.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Roger?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
How long, then?
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Yeah, yeah.
Why not? Why the fuck not?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
I don't know what you're talking about?
You smashed it!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
You're a pal.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
No. I'll try again later.
What?
The what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Epps, over.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Shut up.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Leave it.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
I...
What do you mean?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
Jesus...
So, where's "Weird Al"?
I figured something like that...
Yeah, well... hi...
What do you mean "why"?
Then why do you hate me so much?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Just look at them!
Okay, okay!
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Oh, we totally have to.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
She says she wants to MMPH!
Gross!
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Why don't you ask him.
JOSH!
I didn't get it either.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
You're insane.
Why? What did he say?
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
So where's all your stuff?
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
Yes.
What?
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Sure, I guess.
Really? Can I see it?
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
YAAA!
Really?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
In what way do you mean?
Uh... sure... come in.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I don't know... where is she, then?
That slut!
Yes?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
What?
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
You mean nobody died?
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Has it ever done that before?
Only in life... 
What happened to them?
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Was that supposed to make me feel better? 
Good luck.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
The workers don't get on?
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Four should do it.
Not even close.  What happened?
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
You're also a human being, Frank.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
I'll supervise.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Good luck.
Good-bye, Peter.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Ghostbusters.
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
Tonight?
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Get on with it, counselor!
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I don't even want to know where that is.
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
From where -- Neptune?
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
And we're the ...
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
I got the Twister game for later ...
I know.  It happened by itself.
Then leave.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
Really!  Is it gone?
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
We'll get back to you.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
That's "Peck!"
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
I'm always serious.
Does she want to be?
I agree.
Oh, shit!
God, it's ugly!
Neutronize.  System shut.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Look!
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Right.  We'll believe anything.
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Do you want posters, too?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
We have to stop the Germans now!
On what charge?
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
So am I.
Give away food?
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
I'll nose around...
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
Sneaking around with your brother?
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
They fear me.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
As soon as I can.
Well, they die for it!
I can't let you do that.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
You teach them!
I killed too many barbarians.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
That's one way to look at it.
Alive... I'm alive...
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Before they leave, get gold.
Was I?
No.
Yes.
I just want to tell you something.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
We won't. Let's go inside.
All right.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
With a family?
Okay.
Benjamin -- I really do.
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
But you're not enrolled.
What?
Because -- I am.
I don't feel well.
But Elaine --
Why do you have to see him?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
The day after tomorrow?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Ben.
Ahhh.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
No, sir.
Get out!
Well I'll hand it to you.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Will you sign the register, please?
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
What do you mean?
What?
Benjamin?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Come on.
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Well -- do you want to go up first?
What?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
This is all terribly wrong.
You can admit that, can't you?
Anything. Anything at all.
Well?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
I got up.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
I don't remember.
There isn't any.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
What?
Really. I want to know.
No.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Yes.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Do exactly what I say.
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
What the hell have you done?
I'll find her.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Not if you don't want to.
No.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
What about it?
That has nothing to do with it --
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Thank you.
Sir?
Yes.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
HUH?
I'd like to discuss this.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Need any help?
I don't like your tone.
Who?
Oh!
Dictation.  You know...
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Of course.
Really?
I feel sorry for him.
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
Yes -- I do understand.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
Why later?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
I can't.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Oh!
Oh -- but -- I --
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
But Doctor --
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
No - absinthe.
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Yes --
You don't understand that do you?
Later?
Do you like me better?
Moreover...
Me.
What?
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Nothing.
No water -- What a place!
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Yes --
Next week.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Last night?... There was no applause.
I don't know you.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Well -- gentlemen.
That.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Pretty as a picture.
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
And if you do it wrong?
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Not much time.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
You brought a case? Good.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
I know.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
But what's wrong?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
I've really got to --
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
And Myra's stuff?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
That's right.
Always, for you, baby.
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
You already went back to work.
Working the what?
And when he got serious?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Oh, come here.
I went out to Delmar.
I saw her.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
But the setup's there. It's there now.
) What?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
No, its -- Why did she--?
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
Care to join me?
Sweet dreams, Blake.
It's Amy Kramer.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No.  Wait for the police.
And miss the big game?  No way.
You sure?
You're so predictable.
No.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
My life is a living hell.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I was trying to get away from someone.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Why didn't you tell me?
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Who?!
Michael Meyers!
Looks great.  It does.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
You're right.  It does sound strange.
Yeah.
Can't you?
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Guess so ...
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
I've come to help your family.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Here.  Let me try.
It's a rune ... Thorn.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
He's gone.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
No!!!
Um.
Oh, shit.
At least!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
I'm liable to find anything!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
How do you know that?
Sorry.
I dunno.
Maybe it's time you got out.
I know you think that.
For Africa.
What went wrong?
I wouldn't drop my gun.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
He insults him all the time.
It makes life spicy.
No.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Mhravitch.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
Where did you get the poison?
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
The smallest thing I've got.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
It's your house, Dad.
Some kind of animal?
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Give us time.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
We all are.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
A trip, you mean?
You're wrong.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
That's what you're supposed to say.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Yes.
Sneaking in the back door.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Sounds quite beautiful.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
You've killed women?
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Hello, Mother.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
You have chills?
Would you say that again?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
Correct.
You haven't heard me yet.
You're old--so old.
Poison.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Who's dead?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Yes.
I don't care what she wears.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
A lot of people don't.
I don't really know.
Who have you been talking to?
Then who flushed the toilet?
For Heaven's sakes!
What?
He can hardly talk.
Yeah.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
My father!
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
It's fine!
No!
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
Far as I know.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
Take plenty of cigars.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
The what?
It's suicide!
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Meaning?
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
I just want to ask some questions.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
What do you mean?
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
Just one.
Yeah.
What girls you got here?
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
Sam?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Do you know where she would be?
You're not a film producer, are you?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Half now, half later.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Say what?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Shit.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
But what?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
I can't tell you that.
Yeah.
I've got a meeting...
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Who made it?
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Does she know anything about this?
Just leave me alone.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What?
What is going on?
Yeah.
You're talking about real excitement?
Take it or leave it.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
What do you think of that? Or this?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
What's that?
I'm worried about Jake.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
To his own daughter?
To anybody.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Took it?
Hello.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Yes.
Oh, look! The birds.
Promise?
Maude???!
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Yes.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
What was that?
Maude, do you pray?
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Yodeling?
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Maude.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
At a funeral.
Can't complain.
Yes. It does.
Yes.
War is not all black.
Jeez! That's a great story,
You think so, sir?
How about to slit his throat?
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
But wait...
Time to play.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Oh, I do. I do.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
Yeah.
Who?
It doesn't say --
In private, if you don't mind...
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
What are you, a Boy Scout?
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Good.
Doesn't sounds like him.
Two steps back, please.
Lucky man.
You can keep them.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
You remember.
I don't want to see the dress.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
Later.
You would be. They tore me apart.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe.
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Where's Daddy?
Just a thought --
No. I'm not.
We'll move in Sunday.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I'm going to throw up.
Larry....
Sure.
O.K.
What's wrong with you?
You want something to drink?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
I found a room.
You'd like the house.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
You don't like her at all do you?
Really?
Sure.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Yes!
So lie down.
Not that late.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Meaning what?
What happened to you?
Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
We'll do it next Monday.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
My band.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Ooh.  Drag.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Nobody.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Pardon me?
What do you mean, four more?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Nice friend.
Yeah.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Okay.
Can I help you?
You look upset.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Well stay for tonight, then.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Not really.
I think you know that.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
Great... That's great.
I don't have your number.
You don't ever think about other people?
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
C'mon.
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
To make you feel better.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
I'm alright.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Just local, of course.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Would you marry me if I was?
Well, you've asked.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
It's true!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Enough of what?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
I understand completely.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
God, you ask a lot of questions.
I knew this was going to happen.
Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
You are being foolish.
Go home.
No one knows you're here?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You had to do _nothing_!
Maybe.
Not all of them.
Yes.
Just a little crazy.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
No!
Not power.  Not control.
You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
Thanks.
Call your mother.  You never call her.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Spare me the details.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I want Taupin.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
Why are you here?
You are the same?
We are immortal.
No!
This is madness!
It is the truth.
You will live.  Survive.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Like you.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
It can be different.  It must be.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
He's a MacLeod.
Thanks.
Yes, he was.
Any other I.D.s come up?
What name is he using?
Kahn?
He always did.
You were never a kid.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Are you here?
Did you know the victim?
A mystery.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
You're a kind man to be sure.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
Bon jour!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
I don't blame them.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
I'm beginning to realize that.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Your luck's not with you now!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I notice you still remember it.
Done what?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Listen, Walter --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Sweeney.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Keep away --
Look at this! 
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Where'd you meet this man?
Bermuda.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
You said it.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
We're not interested.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
I know. Where is he, I said.
I get it!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
All right, Walter.
Where's Bruce?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
What happened?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Don't tell me you were worried!
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Flip a coin.
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Walter, you can't do that!
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
What's that -- what's that?
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
Me, too.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
So long, Hildy.
I can't complain.
That's all right.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Fred!
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Who is it?
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Come on with that money!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
I won't, Earl. 
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
What's from the Governor?
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Yes, yes!
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Looking for shrapnel.
He's the worst liar.
Well, for the baby, really.
It's like telling fibs.
Wow!
Kiss me Hardy.
You need trees for an avenue.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Naturally.
Bugger the Buffs.
They'd gone.
Jam.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Why didn't they say that before you started?
What are you going to be then?
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
What about R.J.?
Where's that?
Oh yeah, the tree.
OK.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
But if you did.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Lock the fucking doors.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
How's he get around out here?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
I don't know... about half an hour.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Not yet.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I um... no, I don't think so...
I always favored the Hulk.
Aw, fuck.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Gabrielle.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
Of course not.
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Is everything fine?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
That would be good.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Shit.  Hi, honey.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
God, you're beautiful.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
That's not how he tells it.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Shan't happen again.
That's what I'm counting on.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Won't he be able to tell?
Really?
Yeah?
One night stand?
And I think I'm going to.
Where?
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
You are a therapist, right?
Paper or cloth?
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
My God! The fork! The fork!
That's a great idea.
Yes, darling.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Your entire body?
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
That was wonderful!
Thank you very much for that.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Lila?
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Pittsburgh?
Right.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
To win.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Deal.
Two.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Seventy-five per cent.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Hi. How's business?
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
You want me to tell her for you?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Who's he?
Want some free advice?
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
In the gut, I mean.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
I asked around.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Glad to meet you.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Okay, friend.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Fine, thanks.
What bus?
No, not always.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Hey!
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
Fifth of scotch?
Give me a drag.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Oh, I forgot.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Well, what else does?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
Oh, grow up.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Thousand dollars a game.
What?
You're not them.
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
Stay alive.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Is the hill ours too?
Because the sky is so clear out here.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
What, Jim, what?
I was so scared.
I left it at work.
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
No, but it was here.
What? -- I... 
What kind, Mom?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
Cool.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
David, don't...
A toast to the end of the world.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Just do it!
College nickname.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Great.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
But Mr. President...
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
How long would their shields be down?
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
I didn't even see them fire!
Here... now.
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Peace? No peace.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
How dare he?!
I usually don't either.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Are you sure?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
How do you know?
I came to get you! What do you think?
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Right.
Will you take it easy!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
What?
Stop! Stop!
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
I was the next man.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
And why were you trying to kill me?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Yes, I understand.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Step on it, Short Round!
Why?
Two are still missing.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
Just one arm!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
Willie!
Quiet!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
What above the curves?!
And they don't even know what it really is.
It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
Al ???!!!
Try me.
Who was it?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
My place, can't you see?
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
You said it.
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You are CRAZY!
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Just walk down the hall?
Where are we going?
Who did?
What do you mean?
What about it?
I can't do that.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
It's sand.
A girl.
What?
Where are you staying?
Well you did it today.
The beautiful one.
It lends you an air of mystery.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
I don't know!
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
It's not your time. I get time off.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
Run, stupid!
Just stay here and rest.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
What do I do?
You think. That's what you're good at.
You were with GRUNER!
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Looks like you can have all you want.
She works for them.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
That's nice.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
I insist.
And how do you service foreigners.
Do what?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Don't you want to get out?
I will?
What?
The little man in my...  ...head...
Yessir...very good sir.
No. No one to speak of.
The poet...something he said...
I just work for the travel firm.
Can I help?
Are you alright?
You're talking to me.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
This business is over.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
What is it?
Get your things.
I asked him.
They asked about you.
You're gonna laugh.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I told you, I work for him.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Could I have it, please.
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
It doesn't hurt.
Whoever took it does.
Hi, Daddy.
Yeah? What for?
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Instant rice...?
Lowell?
P.J.'s.
What? Forget it.
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
Good.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
No, I'm not...
Hey, Lowell.
What about you, you got a crew already?
Catch ya' later.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Why?
Is there any more rice...?
Thomas Sandefur...
What's the difference...
Yes.
Oh, baby...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell!
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Give me a break!
Far as you go where?
If you want to do it.
Good.  You have kids?
Next to your father?
Why?
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
What?
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
What do you mean there is no family?
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You're gonna get your fix...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
I just want to make sure that you both --
What part?
I should be in therapy.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
Huh?
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
I'll be right back.
Did you see the tape?
How do you know?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
To him? He's a sick freak.
She didn't love you?
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I want... I want to...
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want to sleep on it?
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Good.  Are those foods?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
It's okay Joe.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Sometimes I forget.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
He was right, wasn't he?
So. Now what?
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Oh brother. Here we go.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Did Marylin end up with money?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Well -- is that possible?
Nothing.
Video.
What are they?
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
-- the coin?
Mother?
And only two are hers.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Nono. What the deuce do I want to
Yeah.
What ten thousand?
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
Why don't you put me in chains?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
South America!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Ridiculous!
Is that his name?
Why? Do you know him? 
Oh, nono.
I suppose so.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back. 
Sock her!
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What happened?
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Beat it! 
Shut up!
Your ego is colossal.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Outside!
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
What do you meanstarvation?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Oh, Peter 
was so scaredthat it scared
What?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Hayin my teeth.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
What for?
What'd you give him for the car?
Nope.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
I'm out! I'm out!
You sound like a hobo.
You bet we did.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Yes?
The dame's too smart for him.
What's the thousand bucks for?
You're drunk.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Thanks, Joe.
What?
Well, you got one now. Come on, fill 'er up.
Thanks. 
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Yeah. Just babies.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
There were no phone records.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
You're not digging.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
Calm down, Dave, what?
What did they...
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
And then Sunday?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Why?  What's wrong?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
And Shaw?
No.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
...you heard echoes.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
No.  Never heard of him.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Huh?
What are you driving at, boss?
Who?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Yes.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
I understand.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
What'd ya mean?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Go ahead.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Look, man, I know I owe you --
She sound scared?
What time do you have to be there?
Thanks.
I thought you might want a drink?
Great.
Was she helpful?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
No, you didn't. What branch?
The Delfonics.
Why?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
For now. These relationships never last too long.
You talk them into it?
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
When did you decide?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
Madrid or Barcelona?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Do you live together?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
What the fuck is that shit?
You planted that shit on me.
What for?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
So what happens now?
Buy ya a beer?
Beaumont Livingston?
Do you got something for me?
I said, you understand what I'm saying
A woman.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Man, I don't like that part.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
Uh-huh.
No thanks.
Were you a disco girl?
Detroit.
You been to Japan?
Who's arm is that?
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Who's your partner?
What's your cost?
Are you serious?
Then what?
Which one is for the car?
What's your relationship?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Uh-huh.
In the chest and stomach.
Then what?
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
What?
Watcha gonna see?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
He's a big one. You two tight?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
What?
Did the police contact you?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
I thought you might be asleep.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She's all alone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
I know where it is.
It's Beaumont.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Give me his home number.
I'm alive.
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
It's fun.
I'm okay.
Yeah, ever since that ...
LET GO!
I could have told you that.
Just my luck.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
I'm too messed up to teach.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
How do you know?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
I can't relax.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
What's your name?
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I don't want to know.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I must have been out of my head.
Lemme see.
What do you mean you can see?
She looked good then.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Coming here?
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Am I home?
Are we in Brooklyn?
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How come? The army?
Jezzie?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Stay away from me, Jez.
It might be for me.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Stick with me, kid.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
You look upset.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Like it was yesterday.
I don't know.
It's strong stuff.
Well that's good to know.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
They're awfully heavy.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
What?!
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Where am I?
Paul Gruneger!
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Who is?
What do you mean?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
I don't know. I don't know.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Yes it does.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
What?
Negative.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
No you don't!
I think so, why?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
Oh I like her a lot.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
He was chasing me!
Close the fucking door!
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Good point.
No! He's coming with us!
Ssh.
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Obviously so.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
I know who he is...
It's my charter. My party.
I almost had 'im.
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Probably out in the back yard.
Older, sillier.
Where is he?
He's sitting in it.
What'll I tell the kids?
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Why?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
It's a whale out there.
I can't imagine why.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
We never had any. What's the problem?
Yep.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Let it go, don't waste your time.
You know how I feel about her.
I'm supposed to be running.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Were we together?
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Yeah. That was me.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Mine too.
Oh, hey Vijay.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Wow, dream big!
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
What? My eyes are not lying!
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Yeah.
Hey, I like this.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Why?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
I don't know.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
Vanessa, right?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Yeah, like people in love.
Dad, no!
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Is this Juno?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
There are ads? For parents?
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
What do you make with that?
What are you referring to?
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
Adele... are you serious?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Early, sing me a song.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Vernon, Florida.
...Too bad.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Yeah?
Nah... how much money have you got?
What happened to Adele?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Everybody just shut up!
...Janitor's job.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
Yep.
Yeah. She's only 13.
Why I give pennies?
What are you talking about?
Shut up.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Why not? You stink.
Na.
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
Right now?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
How do you know?
Do you care about me?
Of course I do.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
Yeah?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
I didn't bleed.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
You've heard the stories right?
Not too late.
It's me. Telly.
You want a wip-it?
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
I can't man.
OK.
What are you saying?
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
I wouldn't know.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
What do you mean, stand out?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
But a hundred men could move him.
He was with me?
Just a second.  Hello?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
Just like who?
What makes you think I was there?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
Please... wait.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
The pipes.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
I just can't believe it.
Boys.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Yeah.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
Meaning?
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
That's a big area to cover.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Sounds very violent.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
We need your help.
In a way.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
No.  You were talking about chess.
I'm not playing a game now.
What is this?
What?  By attacking me?
I tried again and got through.
Then why are you backing up?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
It's not that easy.
Because I know what it says.
Of course not.
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
Do we have a future?
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
We're almost married.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
All directions are the same here.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
You won't have to.
The Fortress moves?
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
<u>Why</u>?
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
I can. Because I choose it.
Yes.
Staying alive.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
How did you know I had sons?
You will follow me.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
No.
We must try to get horses.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
I don't think it's working.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
Freylag's stronghold?
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
I knew.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
With an old voice?
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
No.
That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Good.
OK.
OK.
Mathilda, stop, please!
...OK.  I love you anyway.
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
...I don't know.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Three times, then two times.
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Huh?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No...
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
...Yeah.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Here comes the resume.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
What?
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Yes -- you are.
The new store?
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Then why?
You like to take walks?
You've just decided, is that right?
Don't be so sure.
It'll make it.
Yes.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
That's all right isn't it?
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
Damn baby, relax.  I'm getting to it.  From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
California.
Tomorrow.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
You're amazing.
Don't do this.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
No.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
No?
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Be careful.
Can we just forget it?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Will you lighten up, please?
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Yes.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
How much, do you think?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
I can't tell you.
I loved him!
Go to hell.
You're fired. I have new representation.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
I guess.
Yes.
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
So everything you just said --
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
How about --
What'd you do?
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Yes, you are.
Yes, he is.
What?!
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Neat.
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
Why?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
What happened?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
Where's Warner?
Of course.
And I fully support that.
I completely agree.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Really?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
It's not a Theta --
Cunnilingus?
Yeah, luckily.
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
Do it now!
Oh, yes...
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
Or looked so beautiful...
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
There must be an answer somewhere.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
It bodes evil.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
There isn't much time!
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
Sorry.
Are you honest?
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
Tis the truth.
My lady mocks me.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Not very precise directions.
As fair as me?
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
I'd be honored.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
You do know where it is?
I don't think Dad wants you home.
You'd better call and cancel.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
I might not stay, anyway.
I'll get your back.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
Okay.  I guess.
Not if what he left me was real.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's not the type to worry.
No.
A violation?
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
how much weight have you lost?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
He buys and sells the world.
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
For everything.
I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
She didn't really say.
You're here early today.
Because I live there.
I'll get your bag.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
It'll be fine.
Hey...hey!
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I know.  Why?
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
To hide a black eye.
That's so weird...
She seemed upset.
Here.
Thanks for telling me.
At least your father tried, George.
I need you to do me a favor.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Money?
Where will you live?
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Last time you were gone for a week!
Well, for later then.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Do you remember?
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
Oh...with his ear infection!
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
That was the truth.
You've never said that before.
If I weren't married?
Peter left me yesterday.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
No.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
I know.
What are you doing home?
Nigger.
Want me to come back some other time?
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
That's because I've never been here before.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Start your job? What kind of job?
That's some long green.
A loan officer?
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
He does it all by himself.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
You still got that map?
You drew this?!
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
I'm not working on a plan.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Go where, Ray?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
You heard what the man said! Move it!
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Rayford!
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
Understood.
It's just such a slap in the face.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
I'm calling you out, brother...
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
What can I do about it?
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
You did it for Namath.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Beast.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
So I followed him...
Dude. Seriously?
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Off limits.
It'll be all right...
We're ready.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Your own work?
Not in my time...
Just wondered... what happens?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
I'm fine...  See you...
Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
I'm very smart.
Jessica.
Of course.
I'm going to run.
That's tomorrow.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
That's nice.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I -- I can't.
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
For us.
I doubt it.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
...But I still have the choice...?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
Things change!
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
What people?
Where are you going?
Hello.
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Pile in.
Or something.
I can't see you tonight.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
Pete... Don't...
Yeah. Call him.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Sit down a minute.
Sit down.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Yes.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
No, sir, it's not.
What about yesterday?
No... I don't. Why?
I don't know yet.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Who the hell owns that dog?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
All right.
Two detectives are coming out.
What?
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
But...
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
It'll be ready.
Sorry... I...
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Sure. Sure I do.
I don't know.
Come on... get in.
I was?
YOU'RE SORRY!!
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Have I?
Horns?
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
All right.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
He amputated his own leg?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
Yes.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Oh, dear.
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Yes.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Yes.
Yes.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
Well - I mean
Chang! Chang! Chang!
I don't see that there's anything to say.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
You're wrong, George.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
What if he refuses?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
I wonder.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Why?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
What happens if I say no?
Yes, sir.
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Actually, sir--
All the time, sir.
You do?
Kay, I'm sorry...
What?  Who the hell are you?
Sir, you can't just--
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Right.
She didn't even know you. .
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
Hold it.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
The radio show?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Why not?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
What the hell does that mean?
Actually... I don't know.
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Did he say where?
Come again?
The what?
Did it leave?
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
Can you see?
What?
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Yes, sir.
Tuck in your shirt.
I go running down there.
In the middle of the night?
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
To Hineman?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
Flaws.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Oh... Hi, John.
I need help with her.
She's a precog?
So now I need you to hack into her.
Come on!
What the hell.
Oh, Sean --
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I forgive you.
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
You don't seem all that proud.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
And how did Lamar become involved?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
If... you have one.
I thought you were retiring?
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
Sean --
I'll be right there.
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
This murder is happening at two different times.
Precog Deja Vu...
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Right here.
Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Knott!
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
It was nobody's fault.
Yes.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
What was it then?
I haven't seen him in two years.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Good luck.
You sure? I just made it.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
He's okay.
He's alright.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
Excuse --
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
Shit.
No.
He must have that shit troughed.
That it?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Pshhh...
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I know.
Yeah.
We get it. We're sorry.
Where's the drop?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
No. That's cool, man.
Taken care of?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Any time, bro.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
Don't be shitty.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I got no idea.
I will.
I thought you hate that club.
I think we might.
Seat belt.
Yeah, I guess.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
Well, I don't want to walk.
How'd they know who you were?
So they said more than the address.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
He woulda told us right?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
C'mon, man...
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
I'm your soldier.
The what?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Where do you get this shit?
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Yeah. I want it.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
He's on the list.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Watch it...
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Tell me.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
It's a digestif.
She poured it for --
Outfit? What's he talking about?
I am.
A rose by any other name would --
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
How 'bout that?
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
When?
I'm working on it.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay. Show me, man.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Read it and keep on reading.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I sure met some.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
Tell Him that.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
You have enough worries of your own.
Why do you ask?
Just an idle question.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
What color were the original Hebrews?
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Allah Akbar.
"His greatest greatness."
I do know I love you.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Yes sir.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
So where do we begin?
I show, you give me the information?
[Who's the boss?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
I came to visit you.
I said the plan was right here.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Who's Emilio?
I'm looking for potential.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
How do you think he got out?
Well, I let him go.
My ankle.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
You were never late before, I was worried.
I know you're not.
Are you afraid of me?
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
You're American.
Last night. Do you know something?
What was her name?
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
When?
You do?
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
He has to go.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[And left three more dead men.]
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
And they took that away.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
Are you kidding?
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Who?
What they say?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Who?
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I don't.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Nothing.
I'd like that very much.
I'll wait for your call.
All right.
How do you do?
Okay.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Sure, what?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
You gonna die without a son.
What, Ma?
Hiya, Ralph...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Well...
That's all right, that's all right...
Sure, sure.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
You talked to Walt?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
How you, Radar?
That's right.
Where?
Or her figger.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
I can't... couldn't.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I found a doner.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Oh, Jesus.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
You're leaving tomorrow?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
I didn't have much choice.
Yeah!
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
No, never in the slightest.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
You can cut the bow.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
Yes, that's what I mean.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
What's that, Henry?
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes!
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
No.
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
The Websters!
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
What?
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Wait a minute . . .
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
John Doe.
A deal?
Well, you're catching on.
What bonus?
Well, maybe you're right.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Where's Connell?
What do you do when you work?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
The heelots!
Sure. Mostly often.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Nineteen!
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
Of course.
You can't help me, man.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
That's right.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
I have to go face to face.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
You'd never been out of New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
How did you like Toronto?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
I think so.
It's against my nature.
To save lives.
You're a compulsive gambler?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
Occasionally you lose.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
And what about the ones you don't save?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Let me show you something, Ray.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Greg.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
And it's hard to get.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
Scottie...
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
You let us worry about that.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
-- No.
Guests?
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
At least a day.
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
I'm South Dakota.
-- Christoph changed the maze.
The truth.
Then where is she?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Where?
If she's alive, you get it back.
Yes.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
You weren't real.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Just like that --
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Checking connection.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
WHITE TIGER!
... I just pray we're not too late.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
Ryan's Comet!!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
A real shame.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
How about Major Moron?
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
So they've been destroyed?
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Activating Power Scope!
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Why should I be?
I came into this world flat on my ass.
No. Not everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Could we step outside?
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
You got men on Profaci's place?
Long as Charlie says.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
For what?
I was calling yesterday.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Ya piss like a man.
You gotta plan these things.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Not if they all die at once.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
You get fifteen percent.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We can operate around these guys.
Shuddup.
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Hell. It's been four days!
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Olive or eyeball?
Well - you'd need a body.
Death! Thank you!
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Monkeybone...!?
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I don't think so.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
What?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
You know ...  ... whoops!
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Forty-five all total.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
Thanks very much, sonny--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Drunks are funny--
My friends?
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Diz--
Any time.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
What is it?
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
*But you never asked me*!
Me! Jim--how--?
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Y-yes, Jim.
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Aw--
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Look! There it is!
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
For a *question*.
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Convene?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
And with your help--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
What?
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Thanks very much.
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
I also answer to whistles.
Abigail.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Second drawer.
Do you want to dictate them?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Well, I guess it's a chance.
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
I'm splendid, too.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Yeah?  And what else?
Why don't you do it yourself?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
It's crucifying him--!
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Page boys!
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Deeds?
Yes, I
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir.
Next, please.
Your Honor!
No!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Are they true!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Tell me more about yourself.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Really?
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Nothing.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
Had the boys follow us.
Sure.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Come on - let's go!
John
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
He's not home, I tell you!
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
Hang up.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I've got one for Cobb
Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Entertainment?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Are those stories true?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Take the stand!
Proceed.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
Oh. Oh!
Is she home?
Excuse me. What did you say?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Looking for?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Mr. Cook.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
But you do therapy?
...And I from Phyllis.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Are we?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
You've done well.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Who was that?
Oh, I don't know...
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
He told you.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
-- Go on!
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
What kind of doctor are you?
What?
I think you know what I mean.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
No.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Is that like a party trick?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
That's... good?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Um-huh.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
What?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
True. Should we stop them?
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Well, there's Lily.
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Things got a lot worse.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
You will not believe it.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
And what did he say?
I would never!
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
I know my treasure.
We're about to be shown the way.
The things that get you excited.
And what is that?
Because that's my name.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
No, we are not.
I was mistaken.
Way to go, Evy.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Still...
Read the inscription on the cover!
What's it look like!?
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
Got it.
I knew you'd know.
Really?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
He was cute though.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
I dunno.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
You're nuts.
Against.
Who?
Alone tonight?
What have they got that we ain't got?
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
Monica!
I just know.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
SO WHAT?
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Wait!... Look!
He hasn't stolen it yet.
The Eradicators!
Anybody got any?
We're superheroes.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Ask her out.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Cavalry?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Yes, I am.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
Why didn't you wake me then?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
I'll have the fire built up.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
No.
She must have been in love with you.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
Open the door.  It's me.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
There's probably some explanation.
What are you talking about?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
Do you know what you're saying?
Can you give me a drink, please?
Yes, I do -- very much.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Is he alone?
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Don't move me.
I'm gone.
What about the dog?
Nobody!
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I know, be still.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Damn, you got a stalker.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Ain't no windows in here.
No.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
All damn.
Have you seen Day-Day?
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
You could sell your Beamer.
Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
What urgent message?
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Good, let's get out.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
What's the matter?
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
Who, him? Just visiting.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
Business or pleasure?
Business.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Good.
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
Okay...
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
No way.
No. Kisses to you.
I remember. The big tipper.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
Thank you.
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
It better be.
Put her on.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
You, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
You have all sinned!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
I'll be switched!...
All to pieces!
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
John don't like him much.
The money, Icey.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Mister Powell!
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
The Blue Men?
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
No, that's just it. No.
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Come on, children!
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
All right.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
I was praying.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
I sure as hell hope so.
No.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Meanwhile...?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Right home after. See you.
Warm milk. Gross.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
S'curity.
We should get her out of here...
You were screaming like crazy.
No.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
Which part of the room is mine?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
With two f's, if you please.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
Shall we tell her?
The Duchess...
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Comrade Kopalski...
A cow?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
Yes, Comrade.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
What can I do about it?
You want me to go in there?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Why should I take a chance?
Gladly.
How long do we have to wait here?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Yes, very strange.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Ni-notchka.
That is correct.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
Let's forget that we ever met.
I don't like your following me.
Why?
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Yes... a little white house.
All right, we'll make it red.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
Yes... a kiss... salute!
No, no music.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
What is this, Swana?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
May I have your bags, madame?
Yes... leaving immediately.
At Pre Mathieu's.
My jewels?!
You did say it, sir.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
I understand that, sir.
You do it.
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
How so?
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
He wants money.
Pay him.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
Why not?
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
I thought the gloves were off.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
... go on.
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
That's right ...
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
Fucking hell.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
There's no other choice.
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
The hell with 'em.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Amen to that.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
Anything.
I've missed you.
Because ... I have to relax.
Yes!
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
Won or lost?
How you been, Ellis?
Didn't know there was any.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
Uh-huh.
Well what would you call him.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
He can take all comers.
It could be.
Uh-huh.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
Mm.
That's possible.
But you don't believe it.
No. Probably I don't.
Believe you're right.
So when was he here?
Sheriff?
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yessir.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Well. If you say so.
Okay.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
I need to know that.
Goin' where?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I know something better.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Did you go up to his trailer?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
No. Do you?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
What time do you close?
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You live in that house behind the store?
You married into it.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
For what?
How's that?
All right. Heads then.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
No sir, it's unusual.
November the 28th, last year.
Another additional.
I got beers in my room.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Cast iron?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
I don't know. American citizens.
No sir.
What outfit.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
I know plenty.
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
I am?
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
Yes, ma'am.
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
All the time...
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
You're late, Eric.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Of course.
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
...well, then you ain't got much.
I came for love...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Make sure it's elevated...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
I'd slap his face.
Did you love it?
Dr. David Ravell.
I married a car salesman.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fianc is here.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
He has a wife?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
That is so right.
He told us it's in the Buick.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
Where? Where is she?
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
It just didn't fit her profile...
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
I don't know, George...
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I said I'll think about it.
Hmm?
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Oh fuck...
Sure.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
No... before that.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Did Chloe crack?
Her show?
"A Reason to Love."
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Huh?
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
- but now it deposits you here.
- and share one of your graves.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Do not seek the treasure!
Gopher, Everett?
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Problem a p'seption.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
You -
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
That don't make no sense!
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
But... but...
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
I joined the Navy.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Yes, Joe.
A long time ago.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Pity you don't have the character.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Yes, sir!
I called you Sarge.
Where are you from, boy?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Louder!
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Come on. Let's go dance.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
He didn't give you much choice.
I've never had a girl.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Your real father?
Why?
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Shhhh...
Naw.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Do you know that for sure?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Peace out.
There is not one thing funny here.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Please...
Th --
Get the fuck away from me.
They're not supposed to be here!
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
Hey.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Oh, that phone call...
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
What?
Why?
What?!
Nope.
Huh uh.
Don't though. 
YOU HAVE TO!
Stop it.
He --
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
You know that's bullshit.
Man, fuck you!!!
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
You got it. Berkeley?
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Are you finished?
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
We're working on that...
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
I'm down.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
What, I don't know how you mean?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Ain't no one seen him.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
His journals, letters, maps, books...
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
He's not making light.
As do you.
Goodbye.
Apology accepted.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
No...
You learned her lessons better than I.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Cheraw Falls.
You know what happened.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Name five hundred.
Gabriel.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Put them away.
Yes--
Yaay!
Well, I thought it was safe--
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Well, maybe I----
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Allman Brothers.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Does she love the cat?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
Wendigo?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
This babe has said enough.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Louis--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
I just said--
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
That's fair.
What're you suggesting?
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
You're speaking up for him again?
Not as a condition -- a request.
I know where your heart truly lies.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
It would appear, so do you.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Exactly.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
This must be some important boat.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
I'll lead them away.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
No.
A moment.
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Nebbleman.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Do you think she loves him?
That might work.
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
So, I guess it worked.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
That's what I thought.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Mouse?  What mouse?
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
Let's go.
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Yes.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
Yeah, and what might that be?
It's a miracle.
We lost him.
Yes, he might be.
Dexter.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
Oh yes you will wear garters
Gallagher?
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Mother!
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Yeah, hello. How are you?
As one Tribune man to another
Oh yeah?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Well - it's only April.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
That's so.
No?
You're my what?
Quite so. Quite.
Yes sir!
Yes.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
To Old Madrid.
Right.
Here you are.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
She did?
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Are the cars ready?
I have. Double-strength!
With pleasure, Madame!
Have you seen this? 
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
I've got to go ...
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Um ... It's ...
Oh yeah.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.
Lover's Lane!
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Yeah ... How'd you know?
She won't go out with me?
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Yes I do.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
Okay--that's enough!
You're not allowed to lie.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
I'm not sure.
We're supposed to be in school.
Play along?
Jen please ...
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Really? It seems so fattening.
Sure.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
You don't know?
We'll just put up the top.
No I won't. I swear.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
That's right.
Because we don't belong!
My name's David.
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Look ...
... Only if they mean it.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I'm going to leave now.
Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
What?
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
Why?
Christmastime.
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Well, I can't talk though --
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Yes, I'll be there.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I know.
I'm sorry.
You're so scared.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Nothing.
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
No.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
....what....?
-- you said you did.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
....this is your mistake....
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Yeah, no, I see --
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Yeah.
Lena?
Yeah?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Bye.
How?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
Fine, thank you.
I'm sorry.
Why you wearin' a suit?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
No thanks.
...I'll tell you later.
Where you goin?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
What are you doing?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
You can't be late.
I know.
Seriously.
Nothing.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
You ready?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
He did seem a little strange.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
His wife's influence.
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
And place my reputation at stake?
Oh indeed?
How is the patient faring?
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Don't start --
Is it awfully violent?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
But it's just begun --
You're just scared.
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
Sure
Over at RKO?
Why is that, Louis?
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
How so?
The drinking.
Please be quiet.
I can't remember the lines!
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
Telling stories.
Who the hell's Manolete?
The great Spanish bullfighter
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
She was . . . innocent
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
The title?
I'm sorry.
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
Kinda.
Herman.
Thank you-
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
You're going to destroy it
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
Get out.
Again.
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
About what?
For what?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
It's not done.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Jack! Enough!
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Well, that's what I mean.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
What?
I did keep an eye...
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
You sound bitter.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
I just wanted to say hello.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
Can you see it?
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Jake...
Oh, Jake.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
I don't know.
I'm leaving you Jake.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
C'mon, Tommy --
Never felt better.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
He has it. Thank you.
Namely?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
You think he's getting out of here?
Your Lisa?
I told you that --
Who said I was getting rid of it?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Like what?
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Did you get my note?
Well, I only quote from the best.
Lisa Fremont.
Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
In this heat?  They're up now.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
Mrs. Doyle?
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Yes.
I have one now.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
What's the apartment house number?
125 West Ninth Street.
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
The same.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Too close.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Chicken?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Okay.
How'd he get in?
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Yeah!
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Well--
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
What's that pounding?
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
What's the charge?
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
What?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
I know.  That's why I came back.
You scared?
He has a knife.
Yeah?
No.  I'm scared.
There's only one key.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Your father!
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
I know.  Light a match, will you?
You sure?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
So then you moved?
Who lives?
Won't mother be proud.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Neither can I.
I'm getting that way, too.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I felt like it.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
Well--we're newlyweds.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You disappointed?
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
You said you'd call my father.
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
NO!
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
I don't think it's negative five.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
We could live it up and --
Nick --
You told him about Nick's letters.
I love you!
Canada.
Not without you.
Nick, the ice is --
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
I don't know...
Nick, what are you talking about?
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Wish I had a brother like you.
Hey.
I don't know.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Christmas... Eve...
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
No, Gabriel... no...
I'm no threat without a gun.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
'Tis the season, convict.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Acid-chewer.
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How long ago was your makeover?
And some pecan pie.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
NICK!!!
And you set me up.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Was he all pissed off?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
How do you know all this?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
How can you tell?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
What? Snap out of it!
Sure.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
I don't believe in it.
You don't believe in tipping?
As opposed to good?
You really think we were set up?
No real people?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
So what is it?
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
What are you gonna do about him?
Not these guys.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
Why do you think?
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
I suppose that's my fault.
Why?
I haven't got the job yet.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Swimming.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
I said I didn't care.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
He certainly could. About a month.
What for?
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Put on another one.
Lookin' around.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
I was doin' both. Here.
Oh, sure.
Steve --
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Alex, what are you doing?
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Alright!
That we should take our friendship a little further?
I was thinking the same thing.
Huh?
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Shit!
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
So, whatever happened to her?
That means more screen time for us.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Made you say it!
This can't be happening?
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Would you please focus?
Even in the bathroom?
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
The keys. She took the keys.
Of course. So sexy.
Thanks, handyman.
It's okay. I understand.
What?
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
You don't think...
MURDERED?!!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Looks good, Mom!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Oooohhhh.
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
What a mess.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Marvin A. Pickles.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
You got your wish.
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Right here!
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Are we leaving?
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Listen 
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
What sort of danger?
About forty-five dollars.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
Thank you.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
But you do believe me?
Drink your milk.
Good night.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Well, that's illuminating.
We could tell him.
Yes.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
And Gregory -- he loves her.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
It might have.
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
I don't know.
A gay lot - Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I never thought you did.
That's too bad.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Because I have something very important to do.
What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Younger.
No.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Agreed.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Basically, yes.
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Yes.
No.
What about sex?
To you?
Maybe you want to go.
I know.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Why not?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
I guess not.
Do you want me to stop?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
And now you can?
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
Subtlety?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
Yes.
No.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
I don't care.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
No.
Are you having an affair?
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Why don't I believe you?
You've made your point.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
I want out of this marriage.
Yes!
He does.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Did you find him attractive?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Not really.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
And what?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Because I never got around to it.
Questions about sex.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
What!?
I can't believe you did that!!
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
I just want to ask you questions.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
No.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
I like the way he dresses.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I wish you hadn't done that.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
It hurts that you would say that to me.
No.  You said three-fifty?
A bonfire, probably.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Was he nice to you?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
Nick, you're so strange...
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Who was she?
Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
Yes?
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
What's cookin', Bert?
I got it!  I got it!!!
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Who trusts experts?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
Of course.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Do you really think so?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
WHAT A JOKE...
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
You guys having fun?
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
How's the trip?
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Bottle.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
They're just leftovers.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
That's on us.
Anything I'd know?
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Yeah.
Sure is tasty.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
And Lexapro, yes.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Now we're talking.
Want some?
Just a minute!
It's not even a mile.
Then it's a good thing.
Pour us a couple.
You know that chick?
How do you know?
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Well, she is cute.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Yeah. Okay.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
Oh yeah. Sure.
Nope.
Been checking your messages?
Throw me his ball.
Is what the money thing?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Are they too sporty?
I say we check it out. You never know.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Uh-huh.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
You're so negative.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
I finished it.
Try it.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Like what a fraud he was.
I had class.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
I am.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
French or American?
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
Oops. Sorry.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
...I will.
I see.
I heard.
Yes, it was.
I got him.
Yes.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
From what?
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
Who wrote this book?
What's two?
That's why they got you in jail?
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Where were you?
Have you thought at all about your plans?
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
Not for five years.
I had to get up anyway.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
He is that.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Why?
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Good luck, Mal.
Lucky.
Where's Emmett now?
Did you hear his son is still around?
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
Stella.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Why'd you go into business with him?
Oh, yeah? How good?
I'm ready for that.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I am telling the truth.
Good-bye.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
I'll send you her resume.
Even the fall from the plane?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Everyone you know is lying.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
No.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Why?
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Yes, call me Simone.
Who are you really?
You never were together, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
You do?
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Dark?
I don't understand.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
-- What you don't understand --
You know what I'm talking about.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
Tell me.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Congratulations.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
Know what?
That I'm a freak.
Words.
Dr. Crowe.
They don't know they're dead?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Cats?
Yes.
I told you what I want.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
When?
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
They did?
A lady. She died.
...I don't know.
I know.
Stop it!
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Chuck E. who?
Meaning?
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Oh yeah? Why's that?
See?
Witch.
Not according to these.
...Hi.
...You any good with those?
Not lately.
I didn't do anything --
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
I thought you said two hundred.
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Not while you're driving.
The audience!
Down boy.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
About what?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Listen to me --
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Oh, yeah?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
What?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Margaret.
Your what?
Last year, this was a new rig.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
A what?
Seriously?!?
Shoot.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Yeah?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Well, thanks for the lift.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Yes.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
Go.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Six. Got it.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're outta motion lotion.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Who's Fred?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Oh.
-- so you shut them off?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Yeah.
But there were more of you?
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
I wouldn't go that far.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
You got clicks, anything?
That's the punchline, y'ready?
No shit.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
It's gettin' done Sid.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
Got hit twice.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
What's the time frame?
No?  Who am I, then?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
Yes.
What was it?
That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
I love her.
I won't be making the trip.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You talk like an actor.
What do you mean?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
When?  When I'm asleep?
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
Not this time.
I love you.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
I want to stop taking those pills.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
I can't --
Am I really her?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Occasionally.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
I came on at 8:00.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Hmm...
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
How did you know?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
So it was "love".
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
I can't open it.
They called here after you left...
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
What do you want to do?
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Long enough.
I do.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Oh, some shit.
She's got to identify him.
I think -- she's crazy.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
I just sat and listened.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
I heard.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
No, sir...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Lay back, Mack.
Yeah, I think so.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
What, want a glass?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
What's this? A cockaroach?
How about tomorrow?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
I-- uh--
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
You sure about all this?
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
What?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Bonkers.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
I'm not so happy myself.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
What's the match gag?
Who is it?
Yeah. Security.
So long, Sefton.
You make my mouth water.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Sefton!
It's on me.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Isn't it?
You should live so long.
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Let me go!
What's the award?
No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Let me alone.
No. I want to draw.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
We did it.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
You off your rocker?
What's the decoy?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Just what makes you so popular?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Here. Take them.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Yes, you do!
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Twelve years, sir.
When is it expected back?
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
You get what?
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
No, no. Thank you.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
Better?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Is there a problem?
No. Thank you.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
There are no other ships in the system.
Trilithium?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
I went wrong.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
... Or <u>who</u>.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Do you have an explanation?
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Just him, sir!
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Much is at stake...
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
Come on!
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Success, my lord.
Station!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Exactly. Happy birthday.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Ah.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
Our first order of business is survival.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Who --
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Are you running away from me?
I shall avenge you --
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
I'm going down to the station.
Admiral --
Sensors, Captain?
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
Not at present.
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
To be sure, Captain.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Affirmative, Admiral.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no such regulation.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Stage Two of what?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Understood, sir.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Aye, Captain.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
I do this because I was there,
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Please...
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
-- That's the general idea.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
It is.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
Implicitly.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Right.
... Damn!
A spaceship with a missing man.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
What is our target in time?
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
Explain.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
I see.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Picture, Uhura!
How long, Scotty?
No power to the bay doors.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
... Are you joking?
Just use the keyboard...
The keyboard... How quaint.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Sulu Hikaru.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
For someone so young.
There are caves in those mountains.
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
I don't.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
For what purpose?
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
You're aboard the Enterprise.
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
It is not over.
It is over.
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Deploy the collector.
Are they...?
Do you have everything you need from command?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Do you know how they were damaged?
Fail-safe?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
... had regenerated.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
On screen.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
We're trying to get to you, sir...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Why was Data assigned?
What you're doing to my neck...
... I believe you...
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
At least four hours.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
I do not know what you are referring to.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
More lies.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Contact Starfleet Command.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
<U>Engage.</U>
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
We're crossing the threshold!
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
No. It's a lot further than that.
Go to manual.
Aye, sir.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Where the hell are they going?
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Stand...?
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
Yes...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Thank you, Captain.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Candidate for what?
Energize...
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Captain.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
But I am not human. I am only -
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Sir?
No, sir.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
What is it?
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
That could take hours!
This one can.
I believe I am.
I am in a room with lights.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
You're working late.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
And this makes you "sad"?
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
Sorry, sir.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
No, I do not mind.
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
Do you have a moment, sir?
How could I not?
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
Sir?
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if youll excuse me.  Ill be in the gym.
Counselor?
And the Romulans invade.
No race should be a slave to another.
Yes.
I was lonely...
You're not Reman.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
On my way.
Should I raise shields?
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Find her again.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Probably kids.
No, we can handle this.
Thank you.
I'll have to run your card off now.
I understand.
No.
Stay right there...
About five miles back.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
They must have picked it up in space.
Neither did I.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
Oh shit!!!
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Don't... don't do this... please...
Ah no.
Dashboard.
Dashboard.
Police...
That way.
Pancakes.
This car runs on gas.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
I am...
From?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
My... husband.
I am husband?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
You. Mouth closed.
Yes.
You didn't even see it.
I do not understand.
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
When we get here.
Yes.
But I speak English.
Goodbye.
I was afraid.
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
Are you my friend?
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I don't want you to be hurt.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
No, thank you.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
No.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
No.
You saw that?
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
Bullshit politics.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I'm already hurting.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Well... the guy's fucked up.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Your existence.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
Get it.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Jesus, Lenny.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Are you sure it's real?
But that doesn't add, does it.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
That's where it gets a little strange.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
You never told me.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
No.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
No, sir.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
What's wrong with me?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Another what?
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
There was talk of a file photo.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
And one other thing.
What's this country coming to?
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
He's called a couple times.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
You were right. He found me.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
I'll be back.
The little piggie speaks.
It was the mall.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Murman!
I know, I know.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
What do you drive?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Thank you, Nikki.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
How?
Mike...
...not until you book it...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...And she's with someone else.
He is so sweet.
Could you believe it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I would love to see you again sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Hi, Mike?
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
I mean, I need the money.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
I'll give you an eight. 
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Well, let's hit that party.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
What's the point?
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
So, what? Eleven?
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
You asshole.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
Wait.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
What?!?
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Who's the big winner?
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
No!
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Michelle went for you, right.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
She didn't notice.
She didn't see.
A day.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
You could make their heads bleed, though.
No.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
I ask for Justice.
America has been good to me...
Ba Fa Goulle.
Like hell I will.
Understood.
We gotta move...
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
And this?
I'll need him.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
That's for you to find out.
We're all tired...
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
He's coming over here!
Don't ask me.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Until the old man tells me different.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
A million times.
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
I think so.  Detective squad?
Shut up!
No, I like him.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Okay.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
I have to go to Venice.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Is Freddie here?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Ha.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
What?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Sure.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Yes it is.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
My fiance.
I'm fine.
Sure.
What about Cortina?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
I think you're right.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
What?
That's a terrific idea.
What?
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
Why? When?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
What?
I hope so.
Excuse me?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
How did you know that?
Is Freddie in Rome?
I know.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
What?
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I can't later.
We'll be there.
It's okay.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
And don't forget. I have the key.
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Even your fiance...?
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Yes, mam.
My name is Travis.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
What did you do?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
I bought a couple of tickets.
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
Well, I hope he wins.
More people watch it.
With who?
He's Black, OK?
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
With the other hand, right?
Show me how he did that again.
What is it? I'm busy.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
What did you do?
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
One-Ball McCall?
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
Stick up?
In the jungle. 122nd.
What's your real name?
That's what you think.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Pittsburgh.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Huh?
You just gonna leave 'em?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Yes I am.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Iris?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Show it to me.
It happens.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Wrong.
It's about time.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
How'd they get it inside?
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
What?
Nine hundred...
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
A statement?
Well, son, you're home!
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Good to meet you.  Again.
Thanks.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
You bet.
They're...
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
Anybody take it?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
Then I'll call you a cab.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
When was that?
Yeah... me too.
Thanks.
I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here.
Got any money?
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
Yes.
I think so.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Different?
Then what was it?
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Yes.
Then go.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
No!
Try my best.
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Impossible.
Well, you're the lawyer. 
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
And certainly pretty.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I got them all, Mother.
Maybe we ought to leave.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Oh, thank you.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
And locked it.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
We know what it is, Al.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
He's not home.
Sixty...  Oh.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Lovebirds.
Lovebirds, sir?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I understand completely, sir.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
I didn't break that window!
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
What did it say?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
His wife changed the channel.
Will I be seeing you again?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I think it could be fun.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
With my little sparrow leading team.
No, no...
Santa Rosa?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Wait here. Don't move.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
How soon?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
To...  To kill them.
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
Aye.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Excuse me.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Not yet.
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
Afraid of what?
I've had some experience.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
Any attacks of pain since?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
She would if she could.
Aye --
You can get out.
He must leave me alone.
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
What did they give you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
Nobody.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's what Lauren would do.
You know.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
It still doesn't mean...
Looks like you have them both on.
I don't believe you.
He'll be there at 8:30.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you care to be more specific?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Yes -- of course.
That can easily be arranged.
What do you mean, dear?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Yes -- I think so.
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
Just Klaatu.
About 250 million of your miles.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Well, we could--
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Is it real?
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Jittery is the word.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
What time is it?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Remember those words.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
El Vampiro.
They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Where's Star, David?!
No.  Stick around.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
He's not breathing, Mom.
We are...
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Not that poor.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
I hope so.
Did you want to talk to me?
Okay.  Talk.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
What do you mean?
Okay.
Okay.
Take laddie.
Even poor people have T.V.s
I was here first.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Don't turn on the light.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Don't walk behind me.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Was dark... find a light...
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Garry's missing!
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Thank you.
Bennings?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
That far?
No.
Extinguishers.
Little over two hours.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
The generator!
Bet the last place you ever go.
Who else could have used that key?
He's one of them.
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Last night.
This is the way in?
Do you know which way?
No...
Vox...
I don't understand.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Why would you let me go back?
You took her because she helped me.
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Hold on... I know I have it...
A moonstone.
Holding you... again.
Let them.
Where's the challenge in that?
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
You can see so many here.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Yes.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
You know this?
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Exactly correct, sir.
No...
Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
My father has gone to a better place.
I suppose so.
We don't know.
Kalen...
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
I'm fine.
Should we be...
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
I never touched your father! I swear!
Good.
Why?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
No. I don't want it to.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
What for?
I do believe you...
So what am I supposed to do?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
Have a good day at work today.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
In the leg.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
How are things goin' out there?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
That sounds nice.
What?
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
In case of what?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Give me the keys.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
I won't wait up.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Alright, Louise!
Let's get it over with.
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Just past Boise City.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
I can see that.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Thelma!
Are you alright?
Good.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
No, I just meant...
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Never?
Yeah, right.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
You're kidding? What did they say?
Amen to that.
Uh-huh.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Mints?
You know, clean the pipes.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.
Mary.
Who?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Stalker, huh?
Big time.
Ahh.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Any idea where I might start looking?
She's blackmailing you, right?
You can't be serious.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
So she's married?
Oh my.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Jai alai?
Do what?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
What do you mean?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
That must make it tough.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
I'd go with the seven.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
No I'm not.
Good lookin'?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Oh Jesus...
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Just a minute.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Hm?
Oh great, I ran out.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Is that bubble what I think it is?
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Tomorrow...
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
Then they should speak up.
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
I want an hour with him.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
I, uh...
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Okay, Ken. We're going.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
Jesus...
Check him out, Ray.
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
Good.
Alright. Alright.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
And get rid of the dog.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
Bullshit.
Let's go.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Stop.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
We're in there. We're in there --
Go ahead, Ray.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Never mind.
I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Where did you see that?
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Two meters.
You let me make a fool of myself.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Make what?
What?
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
And now?
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
. Yeah!
I'm fine.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Do what, show you a good time?
It does.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
Off me or off you?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Right on the flight line?
Yes sir!
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Yawing right.
Is it the plane?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Did what?
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Just once, if they take your plane away.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
That's because you don't have any women.
What now?
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
For the same reason you are.
All right.
Or you can quit.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Get it, please.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
Yes, sir.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Come on...put his head in place.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Relax, you'll live longer.
You're Kuato, right?
Let me buy you a drink.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Are you saying she liked it?
Level 2.  Galleria.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Yeah, sweetheart?
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
And you believe him?
--I got a trip to Mars.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Let me go!
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Inside what?
I saw them.
Oh, since when?
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Do not talk to the driver.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
You got that right.
I'll go with that plan.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
The rifle.
Me, too.
Right.
We got a plan!
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
It's...gone...!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
What about entrapment?
Oh really?
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
No. No...
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Chinatown street gang.
-- Remember?
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
-- Eddie...
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
It hasn't been that long.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I embroidered.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
You don't drink "booze".
That's right.
-- About what?
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
Y-yes, sir.
That's right.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
Shouldn't one of us...?
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
I want you.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Oh.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
And neither will I.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
How come Jack let's you work here?
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
That's what I heard.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Why do you do it, Laura?
I haven't got it yet.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
We were supposed to be together.
Oh, Laura.
What?
See what?
Sex?
What are you afraid of? What people think?
School?
...school's fine...
A friend from school.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
There's no one here.
Abrams...
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
As far as we know, nothing.
...tell me about this case.
It looks that way.
It's a crime.
You would not...?
Yes.
I...
...of Anesthesiology?
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
I'm going to uphold that.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Tell me one?
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
Her doctors killed her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Yes...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
From the magazine?
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
And ask me what?
Who are you protecting, then?
...I understand...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
It's a long road that has no turning.
...I'm going to need your help...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
They still have to take it to a jury.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Read me what she said.
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I just saw her.
In New York?
We, we were rather busy...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
How'm I doing so far?
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
But I think I know where she'll be....
Can you handle one of these?
It's gone now.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
Looks like the fishing was good.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
He's very excited about it.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
Yes, but...
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
What?
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
I like this story.
Not sleepy.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Read me some?
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Fred Krueger did it.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Claiming their place in the world.
Yes, Sir.
Good.  Let's go sailing.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Yes sir.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
What?
What?
What was that?
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Like this!
I know enough.
I'm pissin' fire man.
Me too.
Maybe it's an air raid.
How do you know?  They might.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
I don't know.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
I can take care of myself.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
A padlock.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
I couldn't do it.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
What is it... the secret?
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
He climbed when he was ready.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
It wasn't hard.
I am accountable.
Then what are you trying to say then?
What's that supposed to mean?!
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
What's that?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
You hitched yet?
No sir...
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
And?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
I guess.
They sure do stink.
Got anyplace special in mind?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
What's that, honey?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
How'd you know my daddy?
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
He's the kind liked it.
Lead the way.
How can you say that, Sailor?
Damn!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
What if I asked you not to?
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
That's not why I called.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Whattya mean?
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Life is unpredictable.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Where would we go?
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Competence.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
...we find the jacket.
Call it a hunch.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
In a sense.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
Bullshit.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
Her dog, yes.
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Sure.
No! What gave you that idea?
It's not bad.
This is worth it.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Well done, James.
So where have you been staying?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
How can you tell?
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
What would you call them then?
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
James'll know about George Sanders.
I got the message you called too.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
I love you, Grady.
Would Walter really press charges?
I said it didn't sound like you.
I lost it all.
Oh?
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
And?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
You want to keep him happy.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
Huh?
Then what? What?!
The birthday party.
Ah, come on.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
There's a million birds here.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Why not?
The mother sure has her hands full.
It's just a city park.
It's hard to describe.
Have a seat.
Yes.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
I know because... it's just something I know.
You think reflection is good.
Then think about it.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Do you think you're crazy?
They usually tell me.
I want to talk about it now.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
We're little kids.
But roughly, how old?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
This is garbage!
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
What picture?
They could eat you.
Yeah, they could.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Since you've had sex?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
Yeah.
Sounds like a special guy.
I was always the one seduced.
The percentages --
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
All three -- in chronological order.
You never asked them about it?
I'm not scared.
I've got problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Now what?
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
I don't know, look around.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Yuh?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Wait for what?
A little more so this time.
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Yes, very much so.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
Are you joking?
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
So, you wonder why?
Why?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
To do what?
Do you consider that a compliment?
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
I appeal to you more?
What other boat?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Unfortunately, no.
Thank you.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
That's not what he meant.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Who?
You've got to eat something Agnes.
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
No.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know... I don't know...
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Everyone.
Oh, there are so many.
At least once a week.
Why should they?
I fell asleep.
Yes.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Agnes...
Why do you smoke?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
You have trouble sleeping?
How did she know that?
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?
Like you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
I'm not sick.
Agnes...
No...
Yes.
She can.
And that you're stupid?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
No I'm not.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
I ate.
We went to chapel for vespers.
What do you think it's there for?
Is someone in the room with you?
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
Yes.
Of course you do. Who was it?
For what he made me go through.
Look into the convent records.
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
Why?
Marty, what are you doing here?
You got to be crazy.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Who are you?
Who are you?
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
How did she hide it during the day?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
What's his name?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
I am not with the Inquisition.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
I am...
What?
Earthquakes?
Yes.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
About what?
Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Listen to her singing.
No.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
Don't be ridiculous.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
That's what I have to believe...
My God, but you're determined.
For what?  An abortion?
The scandal...
And the baby.
The cards... you're bank.
Well --
Just you?
How about Ding Dong?
Oh.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I've made the scene.
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
You do - repeatedly.
Of course I can.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
I beg your pardon?
Get him out of here!!
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
The big hammer?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Have they?
What are they saying?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
I think you're soft or something.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Shall I?
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Y'what?
And my nose...
Do I have to raise me voice?
But John hasn't got any.
Clever.  George.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Where the hell are we?
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
You want to try?
No, I want to go in.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Right.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
How does he breathe?
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
Boy, that's terrific.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
How many?
Thanks for the thought. 
Feast your eyes.
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
No, it's coming.
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
We've got about a week left, right?
That tube must be depositing it in him.
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
What killed it?
But why draw it on the wall?
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
Is that its mouth?
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Even simple.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
So the next step should be --
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Sure.
Is it dead?
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
But...
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?
Forget it, man.
How?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Couple more seconds!
Okay.
Which mean physically going outside.
What's the problem?
What is that?
Is that a fact.
Six month stint on Datus.
Want some?
Agreed.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
It needn't be.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Yes. The Shubert.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
Frankly - yes.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
I didn't mean just the Theater.
What else?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
A dull cliche.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
Why not?
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Margo? Lunching in public?
Then you two must have a long talk-
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Huh?
Right here. A minute ago.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
I get a party, don't I?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
The audition.
Who?
I'll say.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
With the paper to prove it.
I just wondered.
Why you have to go out there.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
Miss Coonan...
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Late for what?
Miss Harrington...
What for?
Don't bother.
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
I'll never get over it.
'Remembrance'.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Of course it is.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Isn't that what they always say?
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
In a minute...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
What is?
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Eve?
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
Nothing much. She apologized.
What is he talking about?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
What do you mean?
That's beside the point.
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
I never said it was!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
What's your being married got to do with it?
But that was the fourth straight time.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
All you got to do is name it.
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
That's my Max.
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--mine's better--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
I was sure trying.
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
The fucking New York Times.
And?--And?--
And I'm a Republican.
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
I've got a lot of energy.
By "they" you mean...?
I didn't do anything wrong.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
And?--
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
It's right under that pile.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Who by?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Ratfucking.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Mitchell knew then.
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Will you step forward, sir. 
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
When so ordered.
I won't talk about the other two.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Suck me...beautiful?
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yep.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Because I want to.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
That's nice.
What?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm not playing.
What?  We both have cars.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Do you love her?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
But --
Pontificated.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
You fuckin' rule!
Dad, come in.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Dude, he does not.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Thanks.
Uhh! Would you die already!
Just like sex with my wife.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
AHHHHHHH!
Like an underground club?
Andy!
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I know. He told me.
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Really.
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
You on drugs? Huh?
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
And you call me a moron...
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Claude.
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Now!
He says -
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Then come find me.
I'm fine.
Come out! I can do alterations.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
I was all out of dynamite!
Why?
You are the Princess.
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Watch me.
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Run, Anya -  go...
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
This is Alvy Singer!
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Portchnik.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Get him!
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
You-you play... very well.
Oh - you're an actress.
Well...
Fifteen years?
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Oh, yeah?
M'hm.
Oh! Italian, right?
You are extremely sexy.
Ooooh!
That's the key question.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know it's small.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
It's his name.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
Yeah?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
David! David! I can't believe this!
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Oh.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Yeah?
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Yeah?
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
What... huh?
Oh! My God! 
Thing?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Oh-
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
What?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Step up here!
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Commentary.
Oh, you got a headache!
Jesus!
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Stop calling me Max.
Forget it, Max.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Look, uh...
I don't know, I mean, I-
There are no twos, Max.
And... uh-
Who's persecuting? She stole!
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
You think so? Do you really?
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Oh.
I was a great beauty.
Would it make a difference?
Absolutely.
Had a little help?
Leo?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Of course.
He's allergic.
Oh.
Really?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
And?
We've heard lots about you.
Nice to meet you.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Probably not.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Whatever you say.
Did he promise?
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
You want me to uninvite her?
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
She left the fucking gate open.
Otis!!!!
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
It's a shit novel anyway.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Don't do this!
You changed your mind.
Yes.
I'll be with you.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Yes I did.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And I you.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Very well put.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Lemon it is.
And he doesn't smoke?
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
How long have you been married?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
You're not serious.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Sally?
I did it.
I...
No, never.
That was my clue.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Yeah.
Very.
Oh great.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Okay.
What does that mean?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
What are they?
And here they are!
Like Joe.
Would you like to meet my husband?
So how much do you hate her?
And the food sucks, I know.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
You -- you think I'm right?
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
There's something going on, Z --
You did?
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Superior numbers, kid!
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Oh, of course --
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
I'll be back.
I can't think of any.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Yeah.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
So I see.
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
Eight-thirty!
What gave you that idea?
You shouldn't.
Cheers.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
I think so.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
Open it.
Pick a card.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Too slow?
You really think so?
What for?
Do I have to?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
For me?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Over a girl?
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Swap them? For what?
Oh?  Oh!
Not that I have anything to hide.
Well -- I guess so.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Yes, sir -- I understand.  She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you?  Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
Don't mind what?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
I dig.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
No!
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
Happy New Year.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Kubelik.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Will you excuse me?
I missed you, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Don't you ever stop talking?
Where does she live?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Yeah.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
North ?
Yeah.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Yes, sir --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
That we're dumber than we look.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
We're Americans.
Looks pretty shallow.
Too far inland.
Maybe.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Nobody comes in here.
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
They must have seen the fire.
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
Captain?
You'll get blown outta here some day.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot.
What?
I got bored in Saigon.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Who knows.
Don't you agree?
Who?
Yes, I know.
Yes.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
No water.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
I had immense plans.
Yes...
And you admired him?
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
You knew him best.
Both of us...
Just something I read in the Free Press.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Then let's get the hell out of here.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
His name is...
What things?
Well , who's in command here?
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
175  CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
Oh.
Was there any trouble?
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
What's going on?
Where's Corbett?
Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
-- Turn around.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
Too bad we're heading west.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
I already have.

Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Get the fuck out of here.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
We were just talking about him.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Not bad.
I've got Jews at my table.
What do you care?
No.
Spencer.
Oh, please...
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
How ya doing?
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
What you did changed my life.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
The stiff one eye?
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Welcome.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
No.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Because...
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
All right, cut me a break.
You changed the room around...
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
He's a pain in the ass.
Okay by me.
What?
Absolutely.
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
How're you doing?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Go away.
Please, just leave.
Now we'll both call him.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
You consider your life easy.
I'm going back with you.
Because...  ... you love her?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
So you're from around here?
Yeah.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
You can't --
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Why don't you tell me.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Take us there.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
The contract was stolen.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Now you understand why I'm here.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Ahhhh...
Why did you leave the Agency?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.
Are they usually like that?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
You said you didn't trust it.
Nothing.
Work.  The things I need to get done.
No.
Check.
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
You didn't take it.
I think I got one today.
No.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Did he explain how this happened?
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Is this becoming complicated?
Uh-huh.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
What?
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Yeah.
This will take some time.
Like you?
No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
But we are underground?
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Never heard of K-MART?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Don't we have enough already?
Nope.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Am I late?
No, We aren't going to do it.
What happened to Katka?
It just happened.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
Tell me some bad news?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
What are you talking about?
No, by road?
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Turn around quick!
Yeah, maybe.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
So, we won't be going to London?
No, not just yet.
Not this time, Kat.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
What is bail?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
A champion of lost causes huh?
We_re not all running away
Yeah seems okay.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Guests.
Hmm, I still owe him.
It's Josh's.
And you broke into that room?
It was the biggest I could find.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
But I have to finish this....
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Heart be still.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
Me neither.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
You do --
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
What kind of a man are you, son?
My act?!
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Go for it.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Looking for something -- someone.
Yeah.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
Yes. And?
Healthy as can be.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
No.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
That. And less strange.
Where?
I was twelve.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
I don't care.
I'm sick.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I used to like yogurt.
That's what I mean.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
But if you could, you would?
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
Yes, sir.
No.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Please.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
Then you remember more than I do.
Where's your old man?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Uh, hi....
You do?
Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
Good.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
So what? We'd be rich!
Marty.
A mall?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
Curious...  Very curious.
What do you call this? 
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
The Orpheum.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Dick? Dick who?
What do you mean?
She plays the clarinet, too.
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
What do you feed him?
I used to throw trash for the City.
Mmmmm.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Yeah? Why not?
Okay.
Jack.
You love him?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Nothing.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
I got him in the stomach.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Sure.
Yes?
Stay as long as you like.
No.
New Jersey?
Not me. No way.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Vanished. Thin air.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Where's the professor?
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
It's kinda hard this way.
Any time.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
A what?
John Whorfin will kill us!
Damn John Whorfin--!
Pictures don't lie.
No!  Ditto the professor-
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Ever act?
Well not much.
He's a great writer 
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Okay.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
Where there's life there's hope.
You're leaving?
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Yeah, but Charlie 
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you  well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Yes sir, they 
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
Excuse me?
Well, some of his throat was there.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Mr. Lipnik, please 
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
Catherine Tramell.
She said what you said she'd say.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
What?
Yes.
Was there anyone with you last night?
Because you didn't love him --
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
No, thanks.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I like you.
Not me.
My wife used to call me that.
No.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I don't know.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Why would I need an attorney?
How's that?
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
He had a girlfriend?
I hope I helped you out.
You did.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Catherine told me what was in it.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
I think it's in New Jersey.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Still not here.
Willie Mays.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
I guess you did.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
You're your own baby.
George?
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
What's his name?
Would you check out my studio some time?
Wanna Mac?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
I'll make you another one.
Yeah.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
Alright, thanks.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Yes and no ...
Well that's a ... long story ...
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Nope, I told her everything.
Nor I, on the second.
What're you doing three dates from now?
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Yawn.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
Dad!  Save yourself!
PMS.
"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I recognized the accent.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
What are you talking about?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
Divide and conquer.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
I didn't kill your wife.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Maybe he melted.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
She wants to kill you.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Adam and Evil.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
What do you mean?
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
She has an excellent mind.
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
Is he all right?
Actually, he took the car.
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
What do maniacs always want?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
I'm sorry. Who are you?
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
And now....
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
I don't want to remember!
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
Absolutely not.
What I do isn't about revenge.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Fred?
I got family. ...Please.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
A man with a death wish.
You're a genius.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
... A hundred and eight?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
What is it you want?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
... Terror.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
No one would miss me.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Is that what you "heard"?
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
What were you thinking?
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Are they paying you for all this?
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Ahm.....
What?  What?
Right.  Got it.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Quite right, sir.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
But is she gonna be okay?
No it wasn't!
What's your problem Beavis?
Huh huh huh.
Turd-burglar...
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
That's better. Yes?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Where are his pants?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Uh, ten uh...
No, Jane.
Almost.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
What?
Won't?  Or can't?
At least we won't have to worry about her.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
What about this Beetle guy?
Who did the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
You can build another one... with her.
Give or take a year.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
We tried.
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
We're...
No.  You don't want his help.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Of course you do.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
He's your cousin.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Delia will cook...
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
Gooood!
Thank you.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
He does, does he?
Oh, really?
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
I have no idea...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Yes, sir.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Thank you, Eve.
How is Ben feeling?
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Good night, Eve.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Thank you.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Thank you.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
I see, Ben.
Yes, Ben - he is.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Oh, I see.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
A flower...
Yes. I would like to do that.
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Yes.
Yes. Of men and women.
Of course. I would like to look.
Yes.
I see.
... I see.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes.
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Yes, I understand.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
Yes, I will.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
You heard?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
It's not that, I just...
No! He's a real gardener!
Look, Johanna...
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
I would appreciate that.
Thank you, Colonel.
It's that serious, huh?
Malkovich!
What?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. Were supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
I was worried.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I'm scared.
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
No they're not.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Yes.
And he was with her.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I love you so much.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
People make mistakes.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Pardon?
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Is that true?
No, really.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
My God.
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
You can be John Malkovich.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Thank you, Floris.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Count me in.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
You bastard!
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
What's the play?
No.
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
What the fuck is going on?
I'm getting better all the time.
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You remember Halle.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
Baby, don't be like that.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Thank you.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
Could be that fall you took.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
I run him off.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
No use thinking these things now.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
She was my best thing.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Huh.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
Yeah, it sucks.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Walter, how--
I'm shomer shabbas.
What's that, Walter?
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
They were Nazis, Dude?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
I see.
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
You're not interested in sex?
Oh, no.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Well--sure, I could do that--
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Now I got--
Maude?
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
What the fuck are you--
No, but--
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Huh?
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
The fucking point is--
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
"Our" car, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Yeah.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
No Dude.
Wha.
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
Did I urinate on your rug?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Are you employed, sir?
Employed?
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
I said out.  Now.
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Someday.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
I'll heal.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Us?  What are you talking about?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
Are we bringing home strays now?
You're wrong.
You've been here longer than you think.
You don't know that.
Look closer.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Cancer.
How long have we been driving?
For them. But for me --
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Hey, folklore--
Join the club.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
What're you doing there?
Christ.
--Christ almighty--
I haven't killed any--
It's like traveling back in time.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Why is there no "our" here?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--bullshit!
Just...try and go back to sleep.
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
I want amphetamines.
Sometimes.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
--go!
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Ask me what I don't have.
Still don't see it--
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
Anna's the witch.
--turn the goddamn camera off!
I'm not finished.
<u>What</u>?
By day? No sweat.
--oh, Jesus--
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
I think it's time to get out of here.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Ah, Domini?
You planning on sleeping out there?
--and we brought it back with us!
He'll never know.
That's the <u>reason</u>.
--I know!
Yeah.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
You're needed here--keep watching--
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Your husband.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Thanks.
...What do you mean?
What do you want to know?
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
I told you. I like you.
Sign.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
How long did you watch her?
No. It just made them feel better.
Got a job for you.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
Don't throw that out.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Anything you can tell me?
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Who knows you have these?
Not yet.
Hello, daddy.
Yes, but.
Alright, suit yourself.
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Yes.
Don't say that.
O.K.
I sure don't hate you.
I'm doing it.
Come on Dorothy.
No. it's not Don.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
You look beautiful to me.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
On a ride.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Maybe so.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I don't know. he moved away.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Yeah. Good bye.
I don't know.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
That's what I thought.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. okay.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Jeffrey!!
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah. okay.
I'll get a coat for her.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Derek!
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Yes, I am.
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
Sell it?
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Oh hey, one more thing?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
What's the other one?
Because they caught me?
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Allo?
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you too, man.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
You fucked me, Diego.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
It would be my pleasure.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
I'm going to California.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
That's where you belong...
Figured what out?
Figured what out?
Hello.
Pablo said no?
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Kristina's fine.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Dad.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
California.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
There's schools in California.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
That's right.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
No. It has failed in its objective.
Exactly.
And here?
Third group. What's your assignment?
It's true.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
It's a question of habit ...
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
No, and neither were my men.
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
I'm trying.
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
But there's more?
Any prints on the nasal spray?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
What did they argue about?
Did they argue the day before he died?
You may call your next witness.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I didn't hear it.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
I have.
Why did you come by?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
And how are you now?
She didn't.  She just left.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Thank you.  The State rests.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
What did she say?
-- And what did you suggest?
No further questions.
Oriental medicine.
What did you prescribe for her?
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
Yes -- cocaine.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Then you would have gotten your money?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
You didn't know about it before that?
No.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Sorry.
Yes.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
We're not animals.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yeah.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
Shoot him.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
He could let you have your vacation.
Some example you set.
I'll talk to him later.
We have to talk.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
It didn't get there from me.
I simply can not stand that tone!
Doesn't matter. Move on.
No. You can have them.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Did we want to?
Carolyn!
She changed.
Not this kind of heat.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
Hmm-mmm.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
Sure.
What's he like?
But I... We don't even know each other.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
No. I'll do them later.
Woman friends, too?
What made you ask such a question?
No. I was just... No.
Okay. See you later.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
How about Italy?
How about Bari?
Why do you say that?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
Then he can move! People move!
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
No. Don't do this.
Yes. And I've accepted.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Apparently just before her death.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
You was just doing your job.
But --
Yeah, you heard of him?
Not that I remember.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
Know what?
I can't.  I can't.
What the fuck is going on?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
What are you going to do with it?
No!  They're still on their way.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Violet, please!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Not until he has the money!
You need the money just like we do.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Yes, I understand.
Lick me.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Yeah.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Maybe.
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
Tell me about it.
How did you meet him?
I guess I wanted to.
Nothing.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
What choice?
Is that what you think?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
What did Gino drink?
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
Thank you.
I won't.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
I'm here, aren't I?
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I think everything is okay.
I know you will.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
I want a second opinion.
Treadstone?
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
I don't know.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?

I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
Who?  Who came?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Really.
Yes.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Okay.
It's a little late for that.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 

Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
...omigod, no...
-- just --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
No.
-- forget it --
You could do that?
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
I won't let that happen.
Not really.
-- here we go -- I found it --
Get everyone down in the basement.
Wait a minute --
That's the only angle.
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
That'll solve all our problems.
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
... yer ducts.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
He will be pleased when he comes home.
In fact, killing people -
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
Well ... well, I ...
Are you officer 412/L?
What?
Layton! Oh shit!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
You got the wrong man.
I'm sure you have
A terrorist?
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
You think these are tits don't you?
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Good!
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Why not?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Stop it ... damn you!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
"And your children all gone."
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
Tuttle?
Try next of kin.
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
I never signed the form.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
How long will she he away?
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Thank you for calling Cen -
Not ... as such ...
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Can you fix it?
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
He flipped out.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
What's his name?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
No, I'd better not.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
You asked me not to come.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
There's no time.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
The ghosts--
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Thanks.
She's no whore, Marcus.
I'll drink to that.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
I'm sorry.
Better bring it all.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Why?
Frank!
I'm not hungry.
Yeah.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Sure.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Of course.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Watch? --
As good as humanly possible.
Yes.
No.
Aaron, will you tell me?
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
How?
Really?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
I'll never tell.
It's started.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Yes.  That's right.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
I don't write.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Why, you need me for the story?
Well...
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
No.  Did he really?
That's yes?
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
I knew what you meant.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
Not anymore!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Anything new?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
What's it called?
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Yes Walter.
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Hm.
I'm honored to know this man.
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
I didn't buy it I made it.
It was.
Never mind...
Yeah?
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Hm.
Yeah I did.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
You're like an undercover guy!
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
You are?
Walter shut up and relax!
Hiya Maxwell.
Coach knows what abs are?
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Let me in.
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Mmmnkay.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
You guys are thrashed.
Hi there.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I should have known.
Pretty shallow of you.
Get away from me!
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Please.  It's so '91.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Lothos.
None of your business.  God.
This is it.
What?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
No -- you don't have to --
Try to pay attention.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Don't start with me again.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Oh, fuck you!
Watchers?
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Football is my life.
That's the plan.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Could be.
Jeffrey!
Hey, wait a minute...
Okay.
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
I don't think so.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Switch nostrils?
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Nuke?!
No.
Yes I do...
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
You don't have to...
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I got lured.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Yep.
Let me.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
You got me all confused.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
I doubt that.
Yeah...you a witch?
Annie---
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Who's he play for?
You a God damn witch?
It was a cocksucking call!
You missed the tag!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Well, I held it like an egg.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
How?
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
What do I gotta do?
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Jesus.
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
You're a great catcher.
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
We'll be praying for you.
We'll pray anyway.
Struck out eighteen...
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
It's a miracle.
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I was in the building!
Yes, you were.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
What do you propose?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
702 472 1862.
Right away.
I don't know.
Eight.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
Why, somebody's complaining?
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Listen...
...very difficult to get in.
Yeah.
My wife?
She came to talk to me...
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
And at the...
...hundred yards further down the road.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
She was afraid to call you.
Well...
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
I'll be right there.
No, Ace.
It's always been our policy -
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
I didn't take your pills.
Pretty serious.
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
He wanted a watch, too.
Yeah.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
With Jennifer.
Mm.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I should have -
You understand? What? Let you go?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
Get - get up!
You get down here!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
...and hypocrisy.
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Well...
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
No.
Can you do it with your left hand?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Get out of here.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Yeah?
What expenses?
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
He won't...
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
It's instinctive, you know.
I'm over here now.
Uh-huh.
Calm down! Calm down!
What?
He's good. He's fine.
I'll be right out.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
And how are things going down there?
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
You're so nice. 
I'll be there.
Yes, you did.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Yeah.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
You fucked with me for the last time!
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
I just talked to him.
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
I think that's it.
Two?
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Get up.
It's up to you.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Yeah, what's to stop him?
What?
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
No more! You see? Watch!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Having a good time?
I don't know. I can't remember.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
I know.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
Actually, yes.
What?
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
Any place.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
Then whose is it?
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
It's taken care of.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Oh won't I?
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
What do they need her for?
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
What about the others?
Tell me what she looks like.
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Sometimes I paint.
Don't say that.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
God, if he doesn't come back --
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
What's that supposed to me?
You were at the Emerald that night?
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
Ask them.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Think you could do a picture of me?
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Naturally.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Keep talking.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
I wish it had never been invented.
Negative.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
I won't let 'em.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Who's this?
I thought you'd know me by now.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Take the 405 south.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Hold on.
Doesn't everybody?
I thought so.
Yeah.
She's not a girl, Col --
Whatever you say.
He gave me a look.
An excellent quality.
She's not that either.
Not English.
He's Scottish, Col.
They all get the wrong idea.
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
The one you gave me in the Metro.
They're jealous.
Must be in love to manage that.
I think you do.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Whenever. Tonight.
You can always pretend.
Sorry.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
You gonna tell me why?
No.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
I'm not sure.
It's a secret.
No! I'm going home...
You mean that?
Jimmy?
In a manner of speaking.
I suppose I tried.
Then say it.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Tell me what she wore.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Fergus.
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
That's wise, Tommy.
Aha.
Horny bastard.
Leave me alone, Jude.
Eddie and Tinker died.
Suits you.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Yes.
And what if you don't?
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Yes?
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
Why?
Peter.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
Aye, I do, Peter.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
So I've noticed.
What is it now?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
What?
My inside pocket.
Absolutely not.
Don't I know it.
Give us a break.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Like what?
Like having a pint in the Metro --
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
What do you believe in?
Don't know her.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
A story.
Why?
The fastest.
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
Who gives a fuck.
People. They could be looking.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
You're going to look for him -- now?
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
Lord, you're stubborn.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Can you remember anything at all?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
But no one actually saw him die.
Agents.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Very good.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Starting with his own.
Yes.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
I met a man with sharp nails.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Okay.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
No --
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Not unless we're blind.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
But his mother --
Is that all? Can I go now?
And this? And this?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Up there! I would put it up there!
No -- but I will ask.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
How's that?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Now you're angry.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
How do you know?
How did you find out?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Doing what?
Instant divorce you mean?
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
The man and the woman are married --
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
How do you know what they're doing?
What are you talking about?
Please stop -- please!
Don't you want me to stay?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What's the matter, chrie?
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Should we close down any eruption?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You think you're my sister?
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
Ok.
You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
Why?
I'm fine.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
What?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
You didn't believe her?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
His mother's an only child.
Did you want one?
Ok.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Art.
No argument there.
Since today.  New policy.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
For cryin' out loud.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
...truck.
...-er.
All right.
You want cash?
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
That dog was mean before I met him.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Shut...
...-ed.
You'd better coast through...
You stole this truck!
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
 Shut up.
Hey.
Doesn't...

...gun?!
You wanna hit me?
 
...do we?
 Okay.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Night Shift, but you might...
...wanna give it a try!



All right.
Yeah...
...yeah.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
Then stay...
 All right.  Hey.
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
...piece of shit was worth.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
 Yeah.
You know.
We were nationally  ranked.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Hey.   Mason.
Yeah.
I think you oughta cut a...
Bring him down!

 Come on!

...here comes the...
Whoo!
 It says forty- nine.
It's melting, man.
Come on.  Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
Be cool.  Be--
...about him.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...

No, sir.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...destroyer of worlds."
Is this stool taken?
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
All right.  After they put you away...
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Pleasant surprise.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!

Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
Prep the launcher now.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
I wanna patch in from...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
That's right.
They'll get a break tomorrow.
...never done a thing for you?
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.


Dead, last time I...
I would've in another life.
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Be sure you feed Bosco.
And don't give him any ice cream...
And you ain't gonna start now.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Here's what I want you to do.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
...colonel?
A man named Tim Ma-...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
That's not the way I...
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
Then how about if I call you "ass-...
...hands!
...on the other end of this phone.
Don't move!

INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. 

INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
I think I gave it to her.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
That's too bad.
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
His girlfriend?
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Haven't the faintest idea.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
I think I'll kill her.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
How are you, Lou?
Summer colds are the worst.
No.
No.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
I want the rest of the pictures.
Matter of fact I do.
What for?
Give you three minutes.
Gittes, stay outta this.
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
I don't want to drop it.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
How did you find out?
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
No, not for that one.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
They may not know it but they are.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Why?
Yeah.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
It has to do with my father.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
The police?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What did you do that for?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
But, Mr. Gittes.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
I think I got something.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Don't know her. Take a number.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
He never even kids about it.
I'm sorry, I --
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Yes...
Of course not.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
That's for sure.
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
No, nobody came. 
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
Elena. My name's Elena.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
That's all there is.
I didn't see that.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
Look at that.
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
Is it good?
Of course.
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
It's - all over -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Charlie, please don't -
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
No.  They've passed on.
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
You can't stop me.
Don't go, Susan.
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Look out that window.
I'll get you some coffee.
Brad, you are drunk.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
Yes.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Yes.
Hey, Nurse!
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'll have a highball.
Rosebud?
Am I sure about what?
It's not the same.
Sure. Go ahead.
Awww. That was so cute.
No, don't!
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
What?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You have a better suggestion?
Who doesn't?
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Um... okay.
Was it you?
Call the police.
What time was this?
We did.
Then who operated the store?
I can pass!
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What smells like shoe polish?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
She called me Brad.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I'm talking to myself here.
All four?
I think they were Catholics.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
And the second time around...?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
The milkmaids.
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
Don't yell at me, pal.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
How? When?
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Why should I loan you my car?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Please, get the hell out of here.
Five hundred dollars.
Because I'm happy.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
There's no lights back there.
Fuck you.
This life?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
I was born.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Make them change.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Same time. What about you?
THE GLADES MOTEL?
I don't think so.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
So.
Lasagne.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Jesus... go ahead.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How do you figure?
Oh, you think so?
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many girls have you slept with?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
All right. Name it.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Yeah, right.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
HOW MANY?
This is different. This is important. How many?!
A few?
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
Goodbye, Dante.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Because he's out of shape.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
I beg your pardon!
I hope it feels good.
You'll be missed.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Twenty bucks.
What?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Take the gun.
Hi, Gabe.
Just hangin' out.
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
I don't understand?
Excuse me?
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
What are you doing here!?
Yeah, let's go.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
Never could save a thing.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
There is.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Of course. Food alright?
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Where is he now, sir?
Keeping fit then?
Fine, fine.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Just part of hospital routine.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. What do you want?
Good. I'm glad
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
The ride is free.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Just had one.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
I'm...fine.  Fine.
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
Oh, my, yes.
'Fraid so.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
Then let's have it.
In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Oh?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
I brought you flowers.
I'm standing right here.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
What happens if you don't?
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Twenty-four minutes.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Max?  I'm Vincent.
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
I'm trying...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
Okay, try it now.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
Who was he?
So what?
I need the job.
I don't understand...
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
You get benefits?
You had to kill Heller?!
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
No, not just that.
What'd they do?
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Shut the hell up.
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
I'll see you tomorrow.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
I've been reading up on it.
Can you prove any of this?
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
How is it possible?
Realized what?
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
Thanks.
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
Back where?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Where are you?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
We're very specialized.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Yes, that's right.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
I don't understand.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Jonas?
Where do you think Jerry is?
That you come with me.
Anything happening in there, El?
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
So?
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
I disagree.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
Well --
How can that be?
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
This is how you see the sky?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
By our standards... yes.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Okay.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
And?
The V.L.A.?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Peter.
How long was I gone?
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
How do you mean?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Something like that.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
I can't do this --
What are you so afraid of?
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
What went wrong?
No.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
That's good: he earned it.
You steal a car?
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yes, Boss.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
What happened? How far did you get?
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
On my own.
Like I always do?
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
Forty-five.
Oh mah baby Luke.
Cuter.
Cuter.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Fear of what...
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
But </u>alive</u>!
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
The same as the first time...
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
The door was already open...
What book?
You come and visit.
Who was the man in the basement?
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
For months... last October.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
How did you know they were stockings?
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
You do that one, I don't want it...
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
Is there a phone booth there?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Who prescribes the brandy?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Oh, I know.
Just horseshit luck.
Classy madonna.
Let's get out of here...
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
We could use a little help.
You're damn right I do.
Because I think I'm wrong.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
Give me Ruben back...
Nikko?
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
Did you come?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
James.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Please, Letty.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Really?
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
Will you get time off to do that?
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
You too, Mom.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
By color.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Paul.
Very romantic setting.
It's magic.
Exactly.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
So there were no problems?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
Sounds grim.
Yeah.    How was the job search?
Promise?
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Well then why'd it happen?
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
Sure. Why?
That's a big question.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Here's the ring.
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
What does that mean?
Do you know who this is?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
No.
I'm good.   Really.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
I'm just setting my boundaries.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Some bread and...
I just thought that--
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Go where?   The police are outside.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
I'm not going to leave you.
You lived there. You know the city.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Mr. Taylor?
No.
I said a clean break.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
Yeah, I dig him.
Cool.
What?
Where is it, Sophie?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
Take a nap.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
The lucky ones.
It's for you.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
On guard!
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
You're already a thief.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
No, really?
Give it back!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Give me back my comb.
It is trouble for me.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
What have you discovered?
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
Well, we had talked...
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
You're welcome.
I lost my key.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
She's still dead.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Shut up.
I'm already alone.
No shooting.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
From who?
Oh really?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Who?
Need any company?
Fine.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
That's not fair.
Yes.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Good for you.
Get off me.
It was perfect.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
But you knew this was important to me.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
- none taken -
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Outstanding.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Is it that obvious?
Did you hide the letters?
Best friends.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
I'm taking a shower.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Same time next week?
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
I'm pretty sure she did.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I'll be right there.
You don't mean?
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Sounds intriguing.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
And if I win?
Interesting.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I'm aware.
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
She shot you down.
It clearly is why.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I have a flair for drama.
Annette?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Didn't you hear what I said?
It's Cecile.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Black.
We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
She really loves me.
Did you hit her?
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year  St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
Did your wishes ever come true?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
She was very pretty.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
It's early yet.
That's right.
Well, it seemed to me --
I'm never unfair.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Yes, daddy.
But this is different.  Go on blow,
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
It was just a voice.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Voices from an old dark house!
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
Because she is my friend.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
I don't know yet.
I've wanted a friend.
I can not tell you.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
That's the clever way to do it.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Look at me.
My daughter died long ago.
Yes...yes, that's true.
I like to see her happy.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
I've changed a lot lately.
Yeah but they looked cool...
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
Nearly four.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
George bit you?
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
No you don't, believe me.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
I've been here. What day is it?
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Ignore it.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Peter keeps asking me out.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
About Benito.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
I'm not really hungry after all.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
I really gotta pee.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
This really isn't a good time.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Very well then. Is that all?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
What happened?
You know, I've never seen your cat.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
No, I said it was our first date.
No, take it.
So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
You're some catch Lloyd.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
How will we interrogate them?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Sorry, sir.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
You seem restless.
You know something about me?
Tell me about them...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Right.
What?
The usual...
And we're going away for a holiday.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
) Listen, you little...
What about containment, Alan?
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Just what you think I mean.
I am the government.
Choices?
You could buy it on payments.
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Oh.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
What?
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
No.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
Oh... Okay.
It's just so strange...
You have a lot of secrets.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I run a temp agency.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
You really believe that?
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
... Me, too.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Look.
The tunnel.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Maybe.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
Come on. Let's go.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
It's because of me.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
To fucking Mutt.
But why?
At Chet Danburry's house.
So?
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
It's better than doing nothing.
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
You have another choice.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Nothing.
Yes.  But
A play, dummy.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
I guess.
What is that supposed to mean?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Put more into it!
Do you have to quit the play?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Who asked you to!
What are those things?
Takes one to know one.
You should talk...
What?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
And what if I run into one of those things?
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
Me??
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
Yeah.
Get the boots.
John,we're going huntin'.
Nick's going?
You're full of shit.
They did not!
They did too!
It's gotta!
I know, but...
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Where is he???
Yeah?
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Sal's alive???
You Biederman?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Naw, it's... I mean...
What?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
No. No, no.
That way it sets.
Huh?
I thought you might be praying.
What do you mean?
I like it, Nick.
Watch it, shithead!
What do you mean, no???
That's it. No. No way.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
What's that noise?
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Where?
Merle gave me this?
Yeah.
What's it for??
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
What'cha got, Bennett?
What did you say?
Not anymore.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
That cost me two weeks' pay.
...Have you been drinking?
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
Hospital food.
You be careful.
No you don't.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Take a look at this.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Of course I will.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
What's that, sir?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
No! No! I won't.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
That's just too bad --
Howdy, Hank.
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
The seventh day of April --
About what?
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Why of course --
Yes.
Jabez!
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Worried!
You'll never change -- will you?
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
I dunno.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
Very well, folks. I accept.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
What mountain?
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Why don't you?
I can't be honest with them.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
What are you going to do?
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
How do you know?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Yessir.
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Well, how'll I get home?
I'm really shakey.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah...
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
I know!
Denmark?  Sweden?
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Yeah... yeah.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Sonny-boy, one word?
Call me whatever you want.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
Don't fuck with me ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
He's all doped up.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
If you take anybody, please take me.
I'll be God damned if you will.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Special to me, too.
You like me?
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
How'd that happen?
I want him to think that.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Everybody!  Back here!
Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Okay.  Which one goes?
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
We can't stay here.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Maybe...
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>Are you all right?</i>
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
What?
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
That bitch called me a bitch.
What?
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
<i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
He used to date Pat Benatar!
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
I was a musician.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Do you know where Danang is?
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
In theory.
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT
Real fast.
Talk to me.
You got my back.
My brother.
Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me?"
What did he do this time?
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
What was you saying?
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
Is it a good morning?
That's it?
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
You are too crude.
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
How are you holding up in this weather?
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Motherfucker you.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Keep it.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Before I get off work.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
You a blue-moon fool.
Trust me.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Ya like him, huh?
I don't know.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
You listening to me?
I know.
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Tell Vito.
We don't know nuthin' else.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
I'll tell you why!
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
O'clock?
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
Okay, what?
So boys, how was your first day?
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
No.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
The principal.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
What?
You're not my real dad.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Yes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
I bet you want your head scratched.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
A turd.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Sorry, no further questions.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
Right.
Okay. Which one do you want?
That's gross.
So can I come along?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey can be on top?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
And...?
Everything. Just for the record.
The evidence of what?
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
This band sounds terrible.
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
This is my son, Paul.
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
Sire!
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
My Lord?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
Your Reverence.
Is he....?
I'm ready.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
It burns.
You feel the flesh crisping?
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What can be done has been done.
Really?
Thank you.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Eddie, you screwed up.
Really?
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Don't let me slow you down.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
I guessed.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
Better than not getting a job?
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
But there's plenty of other parts.
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Oh, of course!
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Not good...
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
STOP!
Well you tried --
Uh, atomic energy?
The poor girl's out of a job.
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
At what point?
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Yeah. Ma...
They celebrated the common person.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
You know it.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Yes?
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Right, right...
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
She could've been a nurse.
What's the matter?!
No.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
All right. Let them decide.
Our what?
I batted!
Who's in it?
I hear the dog really liked him.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
What?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
No... Could you?
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
You brought the cameras here!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Look, we gotta talk.
Ray, come an--
Me?!
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Who's --
What...
The pirate ship.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Good?
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
pierdo.
pierde.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
In love?
But you haven't written your novel.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
What?
Dick.
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Okay, fine. Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
I've got an idea.
You'll be fine.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
And when did you do it?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Three twenty-five.
Sherry... I love you.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Okay, let's say
What...?
So?
I mean at you.
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Thanks!
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
Yeah, plain scotch.
Are you sorry she's dead?
How'd she meet Patchett?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
How'd you get to know so much about him?
So tell me about it.
Captain, what do you want?
How?
How what, Wendell?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What are you talking about?
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Get the fuck away from me.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
That's right.
What do you want to know?
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
Clean?
Say what and so what.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Dogs got no reason to live.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
Gone.  Not a trace.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
No.
Something like that.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
What about you?
What?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
You make a mistake?
What?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
What?
Decorated?
Bud White's been here?
Not good enough.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
When?
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Around.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Really?  How?
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Who are you calling?!
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
When can you get it here?
Told by whom?
Really?
One of many people who would live a word with you.
That's who they are.
You're crazy.
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
I don't know what that means.
Wait. What do I do?
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
They come after you?
Here?
Fuckin-A.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
Are you sure about this?
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
I'll say.
Pardon?
I'll be right back.
That's my point.
Because my life is being ruined.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
About what?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Oh, please--
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Was that doctored-up, too?
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
What happened to your head?
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.
What is it?
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Sir?
My suitcase is gone.
Why the hell would I--
You don't know who the fuck--
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
Brill?
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
Tell me about Brill.
This conversation's over.
Yeah.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Gimme the shoe.
You're firing me.
Where's Stacy?
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Are those my Christmas presents?
You staying for dinner?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Alright!
What about jewelry?
Bobby--
They killed Rachel.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
So do I!
Are you still in Crystal City?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
He had help.
So they know everything.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Explain that.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
What kind of fossils?
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
As the wife of one of our party.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Now.
Don't do this.
Dance with me.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Still a car.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
It's Geoffrey under this.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Right.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Okay.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Don't cut me.
What do you want?
Where've you been?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
I think that's called looting.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
The rest meant nothing to me.
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
I'm turning you.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Are you remembering more?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Kip's another one.
- to her cooking.
No!
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Thank you.
Yes, for your hair.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
You get Hardy.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church.
And what if he really is a spy?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Does he have to go?
I had a hotel room.
Yessir.
How awful.  What will you do?
I'll come with you.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Then you were married?
I don't recall asking your permission.
Uh, yes.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
You...you can't.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
We are...for the tools.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Right. The eight billion.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Have really held you under?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Go!
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
You are a miracle worker.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
Remind me why.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Don't use language with me --
You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
Who?
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
They did?
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Good.
Excuse me?
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
Lemme see it, will you?
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
You think there's more?
What do you mean?
I would now.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
So what are you thinking?
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
What do you mean?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Not anymore.
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I can't leave my job, George.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
What's going on?
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
Uh-huh?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
What is it?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Does Luke know?
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
That should do nicely.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
You mean a man you can control.
I do not!
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The entrance is collapsing!
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
I didn't say anything?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
That they are.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
My mind fills with so many images.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
I want that ship.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
I don't believe it.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Go on now. Do as I say.
I thought he was, but he came back.
All right, so I made another deal.
Having second thoughts?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
Where?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Who ain't?
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
What's this, what's this?!
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
No.
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
I'm not jealous!
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
People make you laugh?
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
Fuck it.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
Yes.
No. Not at all,
Not that I know of.
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Rats?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Fine thank you.
Yes, I think so.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
I'm Father Karras.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Sure did.
Like what?
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
In Europe.
No
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
No.
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
Where?
He's nice.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Why does God let us get tired?
Oh, Christ.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
You might loosen the straps then.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
No now.
Quod nomen mihi est?
No.
No momma.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And let my cry come unto thee.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
What's this about?
Yeah, a fall.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Unlikely.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Come on!
O'Lord hear my prey.
Fuck him!!!
...from this creature of God!!!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Yes.
Give me the keys.
Mondays.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Suit yourself.
Honey ...
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
How we doing?
Am I late?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Her hands.  Like that.
It's not family.  It's business.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
What?
I didn't get her number.
I'll drop the eighths.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
You recognized me.
Very realistic.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
What?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
He was wearing a suit.
February?
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
You could've come.
What?
What disease?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Shut up, Frank.
You weren't there.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Right.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
This'll kill 'em.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Right.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
How should I take it?
So run a little longer.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What-?
That!  You can't wear that!
It's orange!
Nine!
Zip me up?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
I said I was sorry.
Give me that.
We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Smells like fish.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Tell her.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
What?
Uh, well ...
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
He doesn't bite.
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
Downstairs.
I suppose.
Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
He'll come around.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Guess I got a little scattered.
I'm not upset.
Ed? How many people live here?
How come you didn't close your eyes?
You sending me home?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
What happened to the donut king?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Why not?
Sure.
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Drive.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
Like ...
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Jon, what is it?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
What?
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
What's that?
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
The hospital.
-- Studying.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Thats where you work.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Right.  Thats a major oversight...  So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia...
Great room...
Is it...?
Kates my wife...
I never won anything in bowling.
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Basically, its my car now.  Get in.
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
Cmon, as soon as I put them down, youre gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Youre a nurse?
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Howd you do this year, Tony?
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Uh-huh...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Jack...dont even start...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Why not?
Because youll be here.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
Its good, right?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Paris?
Youre not married, are you?
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
Of course I did.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
This makes five.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
I should have done more, run more tests --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Ben.  Are you okay?
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
About me?  How sweet.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
Oh, he did.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
I can go hotter!
Last one down springs for room service.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
Ben did this.
Yes, thanks.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Why didn't you say something?
Victor, are you feeling alright?
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
Oh, I think you already have.
Skeptical...?
Here's the overall Target Area...
Phase Two.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Where can I get a cab back to town?
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
I've done all I could with the laser.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
Then why not take it?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
Sort of.
That makes two of us.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
What do you mean?
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
No.
...Would it kill you to say something?
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Okay, real good, then.
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
End a April.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Just a general way.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Yah.
Yah!
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Yah.
...Yah.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, okay.
Yah.
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
2:30.
Yah.
Well, they -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
The heck d'ya mean?
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
Oh...
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
No, I didn't...
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
Anyone else residing there?
So?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
His wife?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Gustafson's accountant.
Still missing. We're looking.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Three-cent stamp.
And his wife?
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Congratulations, Jerry.
He's at -
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
We're still men.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Hmm?
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
You need to lighten up.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
Really?
This could go on for hours.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
He's not here.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
What do you want me to do?
All gone.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
Is it?
You?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
I'm fine.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Yes, I promise.
This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
We don't need him...
We don't... ?
Hey.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
What about Marla?
You need me.
You will.  You know you will.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson?
No!
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
No.  What's this about?
What was the fight about?
She did.
Hold on.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
That it's not over yet.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
"It?"
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
Easy, Billy, just open it.
No! No! Don't!
Look, there's something you should all know.
No!
You're the fuckin' devil.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Design?
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
How much we got left in that minigun?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
We just take pictures?
What?
It's not necessary.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
American.  Come to get you out.
Colonel.
You're not.
Yeah.  Big time.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
You got it, sir.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
You're all right... you sure...
You still believe in God?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
<u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
No, it's not... Come here...
How have you been?
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
No, I have to work.
How un-sixties of you.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
Sshhhh!
<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Can I take you to lunch?
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
What?
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
You advise us!
You won't be alone for long.
Oh...like Moses.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
No.
You got another ball comin'.
I hope they do.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm sorry.
No.
How do you know it's clean?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Five'll do it.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Well, you seem very professional...
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
You know who it once belonged to?
Everybody still up on the Island?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Where's Catherine?!
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Then after that?
If you're free.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
That's what you said?
Is he?
Yes.
Yeah, I think I could.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Catherine...
It's a Borzoi.
Besides being very rude.
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Hold onto this.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
Steam.
Well, she was.
Perhaps...
Yes.
Fine.
Then don't go out with me.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Remember me, from the pool?
You got a boyfriend?
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
I got punished, man.
Wha'?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Um, yeah I think so.
You here to see somebody?
Yeah.
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
Positive.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
God I admire you.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
I have no idea.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Nineteen.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
That's two.
Your aunt?
Margaret.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Oh, he was dying for years.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Okay. Some idea.
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
What?
He'll be so relieved.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
You may be right.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Its okay. The cops did it.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Come inside.
Take it where?
Only one way to find out.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Cute thing.
Please.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I mean put clothes on.
Can I ask you a question?
Are you still in love with Alan?
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
What is this?
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
How do you know about that?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
I checked. There was no divorce.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
One.
Muchas gracias.
Lock's busted.
Who are you?
This morning.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
Uh, almost.
Irwin...
I never read the paper.
Why not? Oh shit... really?
How gray?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Yeah.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Exactly.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
Make eye contact when you say that.
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
You gave it to the girls for one.
Peachy.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
What a perv...
Are you okay?
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
What's fine?
The case!
Anyway you want it, asshole.
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Are you okay?
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
That's cute.  You're funny.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Cause if I do.
B.O.C.A.
Who brings it?
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Non!
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
What happens to the schedule?
But will they?
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
He got off on six.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
He coulda been white.
Policy man in Queens.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
Pour it in your ear.
Darling, may I have this one?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I love you more.
Do you know how much I love you?
Okay...
I know.  He loves that thing.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
Frank...
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
How's that?
Frank, please...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Glad to hear that.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Uh huh...
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
29-years ago.
When?
I don't understand.
Tell me.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
I'll warn them.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
What are we like in...1998?
You really wanna know?
Yeah, you betcha.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
In my pocket.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
What?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Sully!  Is that you?
Go in where?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
Nothing you're willing to do.
What?
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
I don't know...
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Chuck... look.
I love you, man!
This is all the exercise I need...
It's Friday the 13th.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
I don't know.
Nothing.
No.  I got here just before you did.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
What's it to ya?
No.
'Cause it stinks.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
I hope so.
Are they grown-ups?
You gotta be kidding!
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Yes, but they released me because...
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Legs giving you trouble?
Okay.
'Night, Josh.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Tell me.
Sorry.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Okay.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
I didn't kill her!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
A pizza?!
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
He bought you that?
Yeah.
Not another word, do you hear me??
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
Oh dear God...
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
I'm staying.
I'm staying.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
I...I don't know...
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
We must abandon.
Do not inhale.
What do I exude?
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
Why do you need a radio?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
This building is not secure.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
Two-all after six.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
And you've been extremely patient.
I'd forgotten that.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
It violates so many trusts.
One more out.
You're hurting my head.
Right here. At the door.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
What do you want me to do?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Because faith is rewarded.
Why does it matter?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
Engaging.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
He wears a disguise.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Someone waiting for you?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
I'm going home to my machine.
As I told you about English policemen.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
I dined at the prison.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
Have you found him?
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
Something's not right.
Where did you get this?
Surely you know what you have.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
You had to be a right-hander.
You wish.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
It's okay, Eugene.
What are you talking about?
They'll recognize me.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Where are you going?
German, is that you?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Why not?
Does it have a name?
My medication.  I left it back there.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
Only every time I'm in here.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
Stay clean.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Where did you get them developed?
Just the way I remembered.
That's not all of it.
No. It's been a long time.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
You sent me to him.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
I guess you're right.
Whatever happens it's over.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
I don't know, airport I guess.
Yeah... I guess it does.
I never have any luck.
I'm good at that.
Dillinger got killed.
Just sandwiches...
Suit yourself.
Why not?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You can trust him...
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
What's it got to do with you?
I don't know. That's all I was told.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
I can't Jack. How can I?
What about?
Nicer than most.
Really?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Nasty.
What kind of entertaining?
Sure I'm sure.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Who set it up?  Eric?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
They said he was drunk.
At me friend's house.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
Thanks.
Don't know.
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
Get knotted.
I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Definitely.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
No.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
They're friends of mine.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
No, I didn't know that.
No.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
...they hold on to their money...
I'm not?
I...I don't know.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
That's right?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
For some sales pro...
He is?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Somebody...
Yes.
Hey.
You...
I'm sorry?
Yes.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
What do you care...?
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
That's...
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
No.
No.
I didn't rob...
...did they...
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...no...
Murray said...
Alright.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
You want something off the B list?
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Mmm.
What are you trying to tell me?
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Why?
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
They took the phones...
Mmm.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Go ahead.
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Kenilworth.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Gimlet.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
Who did she call?
To...you know.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
Yest...
She wants her money back.
She won't listen.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
I...
This.
When...
Have a good trip.
They didn't get my contracts.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
I have the stuff from last year's...
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
That's right.
What position did you occupy?
She couldn't decide.
Yes, thank you.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
He will grow strong.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
No.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
He's not the same as when I met him.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
They are everywhere!
He's going to try Panama...
Thanks...friend.
Sleeping inside me.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
Michael.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
You were unfair with them.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Keep them alive.
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
The same assurance we got from you.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Just thinking out loud.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Expect nothing fancy.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
Why?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
I stink to high heaven right now.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
I don't like to talk about that.
Can't today.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
How long were you...?
Oh no.  I never swim.
Not me.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're the one who started it.
No harm done.
If that's okay?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
I see.
I don't remember that one.
Your friend?
What was that?
Oh Clayton.
Fuck off!
You told me to get you up, asshole.
Ooooh.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Thank you.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
More your line.
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Luminal.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
What rumors might those be?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Of course.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
My monsters?
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
Get out of here, then. Now.
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
Something like that -
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Yeah?
What color?
We don't -- ?
oh.
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Sure -
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Hello, Memphis --
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
I heard you were pumping gas -
"About what?"
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
You can handle it?
You can handle it?
What era was that -- ?
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
You boost her -- ?
Sure, man --
What for -- ?
Hospital.
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
A distinction worth noting ...
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
No ...
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
You're going high-cheese, dude --
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
What about The Club ... ?
They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...
He's gotten involved --
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
No we don't -
Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
I'm in construction.
Son of a bitch.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Shit.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
What did he say, exactly?
Just get me out.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
Paulie was just talking about him.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
Jimmy.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Nah.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
Yeah.
Done.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
No, no. It's okay.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
That's one aspect of what we do.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
I'm sorry.
Really?
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
I don't know what it's called.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Not at all.
I do.
Well, you're the only one.
Maybe he doesn't care about that.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
How about the ones on that shelf?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
I did.
Oh.
No.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You've never been out of Boston.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
Why not?
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
They could see that I meant it.
I don't know.
I guess.
What did I think?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
You're not going to fail me are you?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
I'm Will.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
What?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Do you keep in touch with them?
We'll do that.
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
No.
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
Come with me to California.
I want you to come with me.
Is that what you think--
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
You're *ticklin' me!*
Oh.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Deputy sheriffs.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Say, who runs this place?
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
No. They wasn't people to write.
I ain't gonna run.
Lissen, I heard that before--
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
No plants.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
I like the tent better.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Was Granma bad?
You promised, Tommy.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
There, them stripy ones.
But who done it?
Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
But what about this?
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
I never--
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
What do you do?
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Okay.
You see someone?
You met people.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Yes.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
What stuff?
I work alone.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
One cannot love and kill.
I love. I kill.
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
All of it?
I'll pay.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
That's wonderful, Mom.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Yeah. I guess we did.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I'm a professional killer.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Doesn't matter.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
You sleeping all right in that house?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Need a lift?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Why?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Is that your version of a pep talk?
No, you didn't.
Fine.
Did he tell you that?
I didn't see it.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Tom?
Yeah, you know everything!!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
So do you.
Hi.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Yes. We're suing.
I should be in by two.
Riding with Judith.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
The funeral's on Friday.
You've already made arrangements!?
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Huh-huh. You?
About what?
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
May I have a suggestion?
Take your time.
No. He had the choice.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
I'd love to go there one time...
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
You don't seem to upset?
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Oh, how sweet.
No thanks.
That's what some folks say.
Yeah.
Of course I have.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I want to watch.
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
You shut up, stupid!
The number's by the phone.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Cool?
It's cool!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
That's far out!
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
I'm gonna hit you!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Mm-hmm.
Revenge.
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
He's not enrolled in this class.
Name your stakes.
If I win, you become my slave.
Alright, let's boot up.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
What?
Dreams?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Homicidal?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
This morning.
Get up there Rachel!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Can't you find somebody else?
Its too late.
You guys always look great.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
It's okay..it's okay.
Four plus Myers.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Come on.
I can't.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Why?
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Hi Jamie.
You won't look pushy.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Okay, bye.
Do you?
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Why did you hang up on me?
Probably Mister Riddle.
He can still watch.
Thanks.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
No, he's not.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Want a beer?
Promise?
It's important.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
They could be.
Where?
I don't think so...
Same time, same place.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
No! Do as I say.
Will you get her for me?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
There's nothing else I can do.
It means... I see.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Well, let's hope so.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
A lot of works.
Oh, it's magnificent!
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Hmm?
We're actresses.
Oh no.  Not at all.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
What time do you get off?
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
How-how's Frederick?
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Oh.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Why, you know the situation.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
No.
Get his wine away.
Always.
How can we be happy?
So?
No, nothing.
They're in the basement.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
You know... 
Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
I can't keep my mind on the show.
I'm okay.
Huh?
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
I think so.
I know, I know.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Oh!
Football!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
What are you talking about?
Okay, okay.
True.
Yeah.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Oh?
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Easily.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
I hope.
Yeah, that's clerical.
Hmm!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Uh, losers!  All losers!
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Good.
You want some?
Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
Yeah.  Me, too.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
Yes, you do recall, right?
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Well...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Really?
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Really?
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Mmm, what?
I'm pregnant.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
A reward...
They're offering... 
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
Orderly.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
You want me to be?
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
And who is "they?"
How crazy is that.
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
That's why my wife adores me.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No.  And...
I've never heard that he...
I won't take much of his time.
Exactly.
He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
Mmm...
..suitcase...locker...
Shut up, Starling...
A fellow with five fingers.
...standard issue...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I don't <u>think</u> so...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
...yes.
I'll have them picked up.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
How could you know?
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
Indeed we were.
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
Why?
I don't understand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
Because...?
I know where he is.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
Hey, lost again.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...no.
...would you use a small word?
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
You are the prince of the darkness.
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
Nothing.

What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Shoot.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Hey, don't run away now.
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I'll think about it.
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Color me nauseous.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
What do you want from me?
Very very. The photographs?
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Give it up girl!
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Chick-en.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Like a suicide thing?
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
Did not.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You didn't say Simon Says.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
The bomb, asshole!
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Get a job.
Sure. Ciao.
What's that?
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
I'm educating myself!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
looks down at the ground in front of her.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
Somebody's got to help us!
He . . .
That . . .
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
I did more then that.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
I have my connections
I quit. Today's my last day.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Yeah? You and who else?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
I said she's been missing for-
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
What?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
What?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Two.
Can you follow them?
This game is over do you hear me?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
It's getting hot in here.
WHAT?!
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Bill, I got financial problems and...
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
I didn't ask him.
Who?
Safety?
How are they with kids?
Where are these toys of yours?
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
-- institution.
Who doesn't?
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Isn't that always the way?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
Uh huh.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
A man scared me.
And?
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
Honey --
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
What?
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
That's not the case.
I'm having the floor fixed,
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Congratulations.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
No.
Most people are afraid of death.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
Me?  Of course.
That doesn't matter.
I would like to say goodbye.
The past?
Then take me with you.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Huge.
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
In the highlands?
A lucky guess.
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
About what?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Why not?
--for three hundred years.
I was working on the cataloging.
I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
This cannot be.
No.
I love you, Conner.
Get to work.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
They're fine.
How about the cop?
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Canyon Country.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
You'd better be kidding.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I can't go without Thomas.
How can we get out?
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Go, Mickey.
Are all of you named Jones?
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
What?
He has lots of disks.
I thought they locked you in your room.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
These disks . . . where are they?
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
There is nothing to it.
How much?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
What did you overhear?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
The high command? Our high command?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
Whiskey?
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
Today.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Oh my God!
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
That will take time.
I will remember that name.  Let's go.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Homework?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Stay with the children.
In Ruhengeri?
Paul! Then another voice.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
Many times.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
I'm confused.
No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
Oh dear.
Is she alright?
Excuse me?
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
Did it work?
Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
It's not going to let us out!
No...not air --
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
-- was that??
For chrissake give me a hand!
You've got your own TV show?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
Steven??
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Oh, dear.
-- I'm coming --
What's the matter?
What will they tell you?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
I don't understand.
Daddy help!
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Maura.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Why?
Yes, they are.
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Then tell me what to do.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Where?
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
I'll do it!
Every day.
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
What do you want?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Yes. 53
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
"Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
A little petting is not the issue!
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Oh.  No.
Wha--
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Remember that shoe you lost...
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
If you think you're getting past me...
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
Employer?  The president?
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Tell me about it...
The Dancing Dingus!
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
I'm happy enough.
Adenoids?
The couch, please.
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
I know that, Amy.
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
...Huh?
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Norville!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Phony, huh?
As a three-dollar bill.
Forty-eight years...
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
An example must be made!
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But Buzz --
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
Ya don't say.
Ya get the special?
Maybe he's wise.
Hello, Niagara.
She's damn good, Lou.
Thank you for waking me.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
That's nonsense, Alma.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Wait. I want to listen.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Investigation of what?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Elena.
You want to go?
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
That shirt?
You think I --
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
I'm not surprised.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
If you're going to insult me --
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
You're not going to --
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
I just can't believe you could be so --
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
But what?
With Mikey?
You're not a psycho!
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Where you going?
Shit. You're not planning --
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Let's see!
Just be careful.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Thanks for the advice dad.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Geometry?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
There's a TV in the basement.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
With who?
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Charles, what time is it?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
Huh?
What's that, then?
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
Who's playing?
That must have been awful for you.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What time was that?
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
No way.
You don't know.
That's a long time.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Thought you might find that.
Yes down at the station.
But you wanted to.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Knew? You mean he is...
Listen to me.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
We can do that?
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
But you're the fairest by far.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
We forgive each other then?
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Not yet.
Still my beautiful child.
Yes...
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
Love?
Never.
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
Yes...
The crucifix -
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
And if I don't?
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
What about coffins?
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
And you know what you ask for?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Who? Who is here?
What are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Yet. Nothing yet.
No means yes.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Yes.
No.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
No, you're not.
You know me to well.
Fine. Show me the body.
Right. Now I remember.
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
Did you get help?
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
How much?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
I'll go find him.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
All the graves?
I donut understand.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
Thank you.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
You wouldn't tell that 
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
We have no time for that.
If I told you  you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Merry Christmas.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Oh, no.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
I know that girl!
Mother? What do you want?
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Give the flower a drink.
Hee-haw!
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm?
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Oh . . .
Aw, forget it.
Oh, it's wonderful.
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
How's that?
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hello, Violet.
I know, but . . .
Some other time, George.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
The whole town's gone crazy.
They're not my children.
I'd like to do that.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Neither am I.
Okay  what can we lose?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, why don't you say it?
Ummmmm . . .
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
I'm going to scream!
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Mary . . .
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
You going to the lighthouse?
I'm supposed to.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
I think we're changing course a little.
They're moving pretty fast.
Sean!  Catch it!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
Aren't you off-duty?
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
I kind of had plans....
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That's it.
Because they're playing our song.
Home it is.
Mrs. Silvera.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Yeah?  Then what?
Sure they did....
I've never been supercargo.
You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Help!  Help!
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
You got it.
Figure they split?
Take me.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
What is it, 97 days?
Yeah.
And what else is bothering you?
I don't like what he does.
Are you scared?
Michael, the sub's dead.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Up.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
I know I can capture it.
Here.
No.
How's your patient?
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Yes.  It's faster.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
It's too soon to move him.
I have to get out of here.
You wanted to know about a cave?
But you --
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Yes, aren't we all.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Like hell!
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
'Preciate it.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
... Massachussettans aren't.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
SEAN!
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Precisely.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
You have a man near it?
Look great, don't I?
That's Dad...
Who's grown up?
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
No way....
It sure is....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
We need beer....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
Where is she?
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
Mommy lets me....
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
Thanks for the consultation....
You guys must be starving....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
You're not going to bet it all....
No!
I'm sorry...I....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I didn't do it on purpose....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
Lots of times....
Who?
Hoagie.
What about Carla's gig?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
'A Moray eel....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
No way....
Anything to do before I go home?
I'll take care of it.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Yeah?
The van?
Is it your vehicle?
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John.
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I haven't got it.
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
Car accident.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Are you sure you didn't call?
That's just what I wanna find out.
I'm going up to the institute.
I don't see that at all ..
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Why?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Don't mix very well with beer.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
Could you just stop moving?
-- stop --
It's over --
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Well, take care.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
No no, I know --
Same to you.
Do you have something to drink?
Yeah, thanks.
Good idea.  Thank you.
-- especially one like this.
Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Fine, I just --
Will you marry me?
I don't need you to "stick."
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
Good.
We decided to stay with you.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
Yes.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
What --
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Jerry --
-- and I'll get 'em.
It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
I would completely support that.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
NO!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Why?
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Something must've scared them.
You're right.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
John . . .
Everyone, keep your voices down!
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Which one?
Well, is he?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Okay.
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
Why?
Piss.
I think she's with Sarah!
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
Why should they?
Because it exists.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Funded by whom?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
We were right!
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The fences are electrified, right?
Alan?
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
Why not?
Dilophosaurus.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
No.
Kids get scared.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
For a further three years.
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
What does he mean by "target audience"?
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
All night.
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Yes.
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Thanks, Steve.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Why did you do this?
That was great!
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I really think we should go back...
What about that other guy?
He... he's here...
Who's there?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Who?
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
He's fucking nuts.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
So?
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Me too. I'm drunk.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
How's that possible?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
In a manner of speaking.
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
And you ...?
You won't have any trouble finding it.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
You don't believe that.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Your office is the Workmen's --
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
We know that.
What makes you think so?
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
What did she say?
You mean you've actually begun some?
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
It usually is.
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
And we're upset too.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
We're leaving.
No! Don't!
Jack!...  Jack!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
Oh my God ... Ann?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
The mountains?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Kong ...
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Sorry. 
You think people hate you.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Honest?
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Is there anything more I could --
Well --
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
-- Then you don't need me.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
Yup.
Don't touch anything.
I called Trina.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
Can you use these?
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
You must be discouraged.
That who?
What?
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Show.
Show...
Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Mom, I mean dad?
No.
Sure.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Right.
Sure.
What did you do when you were little?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
No, I did not.
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
Eight, almost nine years.
No.
Do you have a lover now?
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Yes...How's Billy?
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Fine.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
No cried?
And you have horses? You love horses.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
I have a copy for you.
Yes.
Roughly five thousand men.
No. Not very big.
Will we ever be in war?
America, we shall see.
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Good day.
But you will always be here?
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Ahh.
Where is Poland?
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Too young?
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Yup.
It came from across the lake.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
What's going on?
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
Keep firing!
Yeah.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
White perch.
They look like they're jumping.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
What kind of backup do we have?
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
You like Jack?
Look.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
It has nothing to do with--
<u>Kelly</u>--
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
But why? He didn't weight the others.
I will... I promise.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I understand.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
That wasn't me.
I think we may be, yes.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Yes sir.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Miggs has been murdered.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
You seem pretty sure of that.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
I am, yes.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
All that detail, just from memory...?
Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
No. You ate yours.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Yes.
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
I - ran away...
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Later, listen, I'll -
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Let's go with it.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Can we rest soon?
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Why did they turn back?
How did you learn English?
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
Maybe...
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
When? How?
And by sea!
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
You forget yourself!
And what is that?
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Yes.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
What has?
What dead one on the ship?
Why can't we pick up his signal?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
I can't see them!
What's your air reading?
I signed-up for the stock option.
Hook's on 24...
Russian.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
The infirmary?...
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
How is he?
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
I'm not touching you!
Well, talk.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Well what?
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Good, you can get this under control now.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Sure is.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
There is only three of us here.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
I'll only be a minute.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
They're not going to jail.
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
No, sir--
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Because it's a job?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
No, sir. Not at all.
And you and Private Graves--
I'm feeling okay--
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
He swore by it.  What?
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
You little pissant--
You still going to all the home games?
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Well--
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
So I'm part-Indian?
Dad--
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
He does.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Mikey--
Yeah?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Take that pair over in the corner--
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Is very beautiful, your car.
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
--Santiago.
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
No.
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
How come you never got married again?
I don't mean Fernando.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Yeah?
Enough with the clothes--
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Got him here?
Want to take a walk?
You don't want to be Sheriff.
Pilar--
Pilar--
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Gotta be in person.
You sell much out here?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Me neither.
You know who it was?
Name's Otis.
Payne.
You heard right.
D'Amour.
He's a priest?
He won't.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
What is he?
Did your husband know Quaid?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Where do I sign?
When do you want me to start?
Sure.
They won't tell you anything.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
It was more than that, I think.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
Some or it.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
You said you weren't with him for love.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Nothing?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Hang on!
You can't.
I think so.
I left three messages already.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
What makes you so sure?
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'd like to hear them.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Yes.  It's regrettable
No.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Does anybody?
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
Sure.  Vivovich.
Is that all?
Can you do it?
Try.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
You don't think I've got it to give?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Oh, what do you do with that?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Ok.
Ok.
No, its easy.
Yeah, you don't remember?
I don't remember.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Yeah? But look at you.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
And marriage, does that get easier?
Oh.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Fuck off.
Do you ever see him?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Thanks.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Oh, come on.
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Hello?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Yeah.
Ok.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
One moment.
Bye.
Its bad for you.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
What happened?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Thank God he did.
Claire...
Must be a spare set.
We're still going to be together.
It's nothing.
No, I wasn't, actually.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
Comfort.
You have to say that.
What about after?
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
What are these?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
He's looking right at me.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
Dad around?
Need any help?
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
No I don't.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
It mattered, Mom.
She's alright.
What'd you do?
Okay?
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Oh, sorry.
Shh.  It's okay.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
I don't know sometimes.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
I know...
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
But?
Just one word of advice for next season.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Lucky.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I know this.  What do you want?
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Who's Spalding?
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Guess not.
What'd it say?
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
You weren't at my game.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Never had to.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
I forgot, "Q-man."
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
What do you mean?
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
You're serious.
Like what?
So you're gonna bitch up?
Business folks.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
I've been hearing you.
Whose truth are you talking about?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You came out early.
Okay...
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
Your door was unlocked.
What?
Good.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Sure is.  So why call me?
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I don't wanna talk to you.
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Who was it?
ok.
You just move in here?
Yeah.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
That's great, thank you.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
No.
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
What?
ok.
Yeah.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
You don't know how crazy I am.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
I want a shot of tequila too.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
Son, please, now....
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
DAD.
No Can Do.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
What's up?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Is it real love?
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
Your teeth are fine.
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
Is this 509-9027?
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Hollywood, mainly.
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
I don't think, he can't...
I am calm.
There's no disturbance.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
THAT'S NOT MINE.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Will you say my name?
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I'm sorry.
Love you too..
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
No one else that I know?
Two years...three years...
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
Yes you do.
You're her boyfriend?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
Where will the money go?
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Yeah.
yeah.
Thank you.
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
..sorry...
..sorry...
....Why does he do it...?
It's not right.
I have money to give you.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
But -- what is he doing?
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Forgiveness?
It is also a place of burial.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
But I was on duty...
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
He lures us to capture.
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Thank you, your Majesty.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
What number, on the first page?
... Two-thirty-seven.
A letter.  May I see?
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
Yeah?
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
So what?
Alright, stay on the phone.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
I'll live...
And he took a swing at you?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Could explain why Fleming was there.
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Seattle.
Please...
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Where is he?
Could he handle a direct contact?
Christ!
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
These are all dead, Will.
Get him to Atlanta.
What do you want to do?
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
To recover the mind set.
Personal ads?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
I won't be here.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Three minutes.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
You'll come by?
I'm very scared.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Are you a man?
God, no.
No.
You will tell the truth?
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
Yeah. It's right here.
Uh... sure...
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
No. I can help you.
He's right-handed.
He's misunderstood.
'Intimate? !"
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
I have to see somebody.
Blue, then.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Can you quit?
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
That's not true.
Go on to the house...
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
Yes.
...after a while.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
Pray tell.
What disadvantage?
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Do you dream much, Will?
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
Those are my terms.
What's up?
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Hi... am I late?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
GET OFF!
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Oh.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
I used to think you were original.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Why isn't he MOVING??
What's your name?
It's my name.
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
Oh shit.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
Sorry.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
How many were there?
How?
Go.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
Please.  Come.  Sit.
What does that mean?
Far from it.
How does she know?
Yes.
That I would find the One.
Why?
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
You're the Oracle?
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Shit, I'm sorry.
How did you know...?
You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
How do you know that name?
That was a long time ago.
What is the Matrix?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
... shit.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
We have to!
You can't!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
It's a city?
They're hacking his mind.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What do they want?
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
Cypher, I thought --
Know where he is?
Let go of her.
I gotta get the stuff.
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
'Thou art then a king?'
Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
Nervous?
Thanks for the ride.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Come on.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
What can I say?
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
We'll be here.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Do you have enough?
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
No.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Yeah, I think so.
You what?
Friends of yours Michael.
Can you spare it?
His wife?
Love that name.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Yes, it is.
He said he would be there with bells on.
I thought you were buying my company.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
'Here'?
Olympic.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
Yes.
What do you mean?
Glad I could be of some help.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
How nice for you both.
Sure.
What are their feelings?
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
Are you running this Board or am I?
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
Well, that's very interesting.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
Make it time.
My Doctor Lady?
I am.
The Board is waiting.
Yes?
It's so very nice to see you again.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
I'm sorry.
I don't have any.
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
No.
I won't.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
How about giving a guy a break?
So can I.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Of course.
Why didn't you stop me?
I'll be the judge of that.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Yes?
Not at all.
So that's what love is?
No.
An indictable offense.
Death!
I didn't ask any question.
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
'Take me'...?  Where?
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
What the hell are you talking about?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Next week?
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
How did you know?
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
You're terrible.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Nothing.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Yer damn right.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Oh, yes --
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
So you're a one-girl guy?
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.

Hi, Leonard.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Leonard.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
You did.
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Strip!
I don't want your fucking money!
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Tell me about her again.
I wasn't helping you for money.
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Help me.
How?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Shut the fuck up!
Thank you.
Sweet.
Are you Teddy?
My name's Leonard.							 *
I enjoy it.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Why?
No! Should I?
Fucking hope not.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
It makes all the difference.					 *
I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night.

Doing...?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
When?
Okay.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
And what is that?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
I insist.
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
That's right.
Zero risk.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
Is this the protective male talk?
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
Something's wrong.
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
On my way back...
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
No.
I am asking.  You to me.
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
...and thanks for the flowers.
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Yeah?
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
I ain't sleepy.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For what?
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Oh hell, forget it.
Whatsa matter now?
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Yeah, well, so?
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
And what?
I'm scared.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
They gotta be.
Hell, don't cry about it!
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Ready for hard work, son?
Get down -- where?
Instant V-goddam-D.
Getchmis...?
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Don't make me laugh.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Billy?
Yeah. How's Mom?
The Hilton.
I know.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
...She was on the plane.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Yeah.
I know where it is.
You can't take anything seriously.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
What?
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
It worked before...
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Sure.
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
I don't have a title yet.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
No, just the paper will be fine.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
A toast?
You really think so?
You've been out of your room.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
I'm almost done.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
They're hauling Misery into court.
That's nice.
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
I'm sure you're right.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Did they win?
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
On what.
Sort it all out.
And you're happy about that?
I knew where it was.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Then we got'em!
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Uh-huh?
Listen to what?
That they're lying.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
That's because I'm on my back.
Something like that.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Affirmative.
How do you suggest I go about it?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
Like what?
Excuse me?
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Why not?
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
I dont know.  It didnt say on the tickets.
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
What happened to Jim?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Very good.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
Where exactly is it?
In Langley.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
I thought I'd take some now.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Theyre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Yeah.
And get a doctor.
Of course I can hear you.
I don't know.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Try it again.
Run it through from the top.
No, I'm going.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
His brother.
I'm getting married.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
Yes. Do you want...
Bus hit him.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You really are stupid, you know that.
What are you doing!
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
You don't get along with anybody!
What did I do?
Oh no I didn't!
I can't!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
I'm here!
That's right.
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
I'm freezing to death.
Ronny, please...
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Johnny.
Will you marry me?
Yes?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Did he tell her?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
No.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
What do you do?
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
Yes.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Yes.
It's a house.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
He's a plumber.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
Am I right?
The Britons.
All right!  What do you want?
We want ... a shrubbery!
One that looks nice.
I've had worse.
Come Here.
My liege,  I am honored.
Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
OF course, my Liege ...
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Ni!
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
Quite.
... You silly sod.
You got us all worked up.
Who did we lose?
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
What is your name?
I don't know that!
I can't take him.
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Farewell, Concorde!
Gosh - Is he all right?
Is it?
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Listen, Alice ...
Make sure he doesn't leave.
You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
Quick!
I don't think I was.
Back to your bed!  At once!
Well ... yes ...
You've come to rescue me?
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Don't say that word.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
Seventy a year.
How about yourself?
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
Get out.  Out!
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
Louder, girl!
Are you all right, Barney?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I see.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
By whose authority?
No.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
That can wait till the weekend.
I wouldn't know.
Why?
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
What's her excuse this time?
Excellent!
A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
Of course.
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
From whom?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Sure.
Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
You don't like it?
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
I'm coming over.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
Like the fractals?
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
And beat it at it's own game.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
What?
I don't want to talk about it.
There never is.
Yes...
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
I'm going home.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
And?
The Cowboy??
You gotta be kidding?
There is no problem.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
You got it! See you later honey.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
What?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
Before what?
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
But, this could be serious.
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Okay.
Not that I can see.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
But I want to.
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm working on it.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Excuse me ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
Great...
Yes.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
That's a shame.
Why ?
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
Checking........
We will start work on it now sir.
I am thirty two.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Hi. I brought some wine.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Who was that guy anyway ?
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
This is California, anything is possible.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
Well you know what I mean.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
What??
We have a baby?
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
No.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
Does she?
Do you have any pictures if her?
Well...
See you? He can smell you from there.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
Hi.
Rose.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
I never met my mother.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Why do you argue with everything I say?
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
You would.
And I thought I was weird.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Nick?

I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
I was commenting on your hair.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Well I'm sort of involved.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
Vada!!
Good for you baby.
I'm impressed.
What Hurts Vada?
Uhh, Miss devoto...
They're dead?
Stiffs??
Deceased.
What do you mean??
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
It's no big deal.
No. Just, more activity.
Okay, sure.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Did you ahh, love him?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
Hand me the canula.
Hi.
He's okay isn't he?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Sure.
Thank you. Bye.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Chocolate?
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Uh huh.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Where's Daddy?
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
To chocolate?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
No.
Leave then, some friend you are.
No, I'm hiding out.
I dunno..
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
It is not.
Not true.
But, I don't know how.
For what?
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
... weeks.
We're about to find out.
I have a suggestion...
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
Go figure you.
And you believe that.
Sure.
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Exactly what?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
She finds him "personable."
Till the gas ran out.
I got the point.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
If you like.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
That's my point!!
... maybe it's congratulations.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Oh, yeah.
Shhh.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
It's two weeks.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
I know that, Star.
I won first prize.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
What's wrong with her.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
Whose word?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
President.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
When is it?
How come?
Where the hell have you been?
It's the den mother.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Harvard?
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
How'd you get in here.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
That Tom sure is cute.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
I don't really know what you're talking about.
What kind?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Who is this?
Hi.
What?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Thirty?
Oh.
I know. Goodbye.
Oh.
Fifteen minutes?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
What?
They said go see the chaplain.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
He's pretty well known down here.
Might be good for you.
What!
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hello.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
No, we never did that
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
I'll be dammed.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Are we in a big hurry?
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
She was born without a tongue.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
What I'd like to do---
I'm keen with anticipation.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Describe Mallory.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
When have they ever been right?
Sure.
Out front.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
So, what now?
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
They've hypnotized the nation.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle.
Why?
But you'll never be whole again.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
And me.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
It sure is.
You in a big hurry, boy?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
You a union man?
Walker and Williams.
She done moved to Detroit.
Guess so.
You must be new in town.
No thanks.
Don't Duff--
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Come here, baby.
What the hell could you do?
Day work.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Well, that'll be the first time.
Duff--
How 'bout the key?
Like a home, for one thing.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
Who is?!
Good-bye, Duff.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I guess I ain't.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
He's my son!
No. Why?
Okay, boy, beat it.
No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
I'm fine.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
What about her?
Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
And how do you suggest I do that?
Very well.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Good, because you've got a new one.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Prepping your trip.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
The access code to your mainframe.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
What?
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
We got problems topside.
How long, Dixie?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Why should I want to meet him.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Won't that mean you're dead?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
What is it?
Oh. I forgot.
Anita!
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Just get in the van, Josie.
You crossed over.
Why?
A--flack jacket.
Oh. Right.
Hey. There.
Better person than I.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Rob. Please focus.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Who are you guys?
Lock.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
We went through the door...
Why not?
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
It's not the gas, Dad!
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
Let me look at your eye...
Yeah.
I know.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
Make a left at this corner.
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Ghostbusters are fearless.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
Hi.
Fine.
Yor dad picking the music again?
Okay...thanks.
I'll need to take her things.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
I had such an awful dream.
Research.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
I gotta stay up, Max.
He's close...
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
A little basic, but nice.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Thanks, Max.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Anything?
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Never been here before?
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
We're gonna try.
Remember -- open mind.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
We can't get to her.  I've tried.
And what are they?
They used to keep a spare key.
What?
I beg your pardon?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Me too.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
I'm an actress.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Hello.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
No, you were brilliant
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
You know what they say about men with big feet?
What?
You and every person in this country.
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
That's spectacularly unfair.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
But... wait... there are things to say.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
What's the thing?
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Yup.
... get fired.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Yes, I think that one may be.
What?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Da Vinci?
Well, thanks, that's great.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
What's your name?
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
The others?
Yes?
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
That's not fair.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
What are the choices?
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
What?
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Yes.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
But you have no proof.
Why?
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Mister Sefelt?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Tell us about it...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
I hope everything is settled.
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
H-Hey, M-Mack.
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
Are they all crazies?
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Yeah, Mack?
Come here!
Sure, Mack...
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Shhh...
Shhh...
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
Okay, sucker.
So why are you talking to him?
What for?
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
I said out!
No!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Gary Blinker...
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Bye-bye.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
You bet, Doc!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
When?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
I don't believe it...
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Yeah...
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
No way...
Why, sure, ma'am...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
Your grandmother?
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
Seriously.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Let's find a telephone.
What is it?
Oh no.  Do you?
No...
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
No.
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
But Faith--
What?...
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Tell me.
Nice dress.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Any night.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Really...
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
How about that guy at the bank?
Is he married?
Is he gay?
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
It's still the new year...
You don't have a passport.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
He fell out.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Sorry.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Is he looking at us?
Good luck.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
And then what, Faith?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
I'll be back before you leave.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Larry, did you rent a car?
You miss me?...
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Went to high school with him. But...
And you didn't tell her?
Mania.
That's really romantic.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
That's all. Next witness!
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
But my own kid bro
That was the idea.
In a minute.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Mmhmm.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
I know. I know.
I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Tommy, what happened?
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
But that's living like an animal
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
You?
You... .
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
Let me by.
Now don't give me a hard time.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Nice fellows.
But you still hold out for silence?
What do you think?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
I'm just resting my feet.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
I'll see you on the roof.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Gimme.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
If I could get my hands on you...
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What can we do?
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Nothing is worth your life.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
As you wish, Master
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Yes, Master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Who are you?
You were his what, his box?
His assistant.
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
You tell your sister about it?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
Half for doing what?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
I don't ski.
You talked to him?
It was an unusual experience.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
Another C.
Low class of people there, Snoop.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I thought so, too.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Really.
Don't leave me.
How far do we go with this?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Why not?
I don't think we should get into that.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
The backseat.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
I don't know...
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I know what you're talking about.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
The fish?
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
How are you, Richard?
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
Hejira.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Really?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
What-- when?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Oh...
Thanks.
It's a --
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
Huh.
You wave back?
I didn't have time.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
None I'd like to share.
Out for the evening?
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Are they dead?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
No, like...
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Power dive!
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
What's there?
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
...He said that?
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Thank you, Sir.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Wouldn't we all.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Thanks.
Yeah. Like that.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
It opens, too. Look inside.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I'll never give up.
What would that be, sir?
Test?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
But I'm remembering the future.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Doing some shopping?
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
He'll win.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Mom!
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Why not? They're my favorite.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
What was?
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
What's inside?
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Well... uh... thanks...
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Dies?
Right here, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
Sorry...
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Ready for what, baby?
He's upset, he's sorry.
Uh, yeah.
Congratulations.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Continue.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
What's her name?
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
What have you prayed for?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
No. I didn't.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
No.
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Were you pleased with his work?
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
It satisfied me.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Yeah... ?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
'Mean the whispers?
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Hey, me. Over here.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
What?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
25 kilos each, huh?
That's what I said.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
Just shut up, okay?
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
Some prophet guy?
Frightening thought.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
You mean....
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Well, what's it look like now?
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
So which one caught your eye?
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
The evidence was very meager --
Well, maybe they're not.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Zira doesn't want your female.
He wouldn't leave her.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Read it yourself.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Of course.
I don't know.
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Taylor, please --
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
No!
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
What are the heads?
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin' down by the river. What you got Taylor?  Let's see three hundred and WHAT?
Fuck you Elias.
You know what I'm talking about!
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
He dugged his own grave.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
You don't want to hear about it?
Right...
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
How far does this train go?
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
No thanks?
Thank you.
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
How long would that take?
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
How did you meet him?
Just who are you, anyway?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
I didn't notice him.
Then he's-- 
From you, I like it.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
And Betty Mayfield--
Do you have to leave the note?
There would be a moon tonight.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Mine?
Ale. I don't mind.
That's an evasion and you know it.
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
I'm sorry.
A graduation present.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
You understand perfectly.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Points very straight to her.
What does he see?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Because you think your in love with me?
Sometimes.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
For two hundred?
Get it in half an hour.
Fascinated.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
How's life treating you?
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
Quite sure you had no motive?
Information.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Lay off, can't you?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I don't think you locked your door.
Would you?
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
We don't need him.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
I think so.
Such as?
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
I am a fool.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I do.
This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
It's kind of you to see me.
He was delightful.
It's fine, thank you.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Yes.
Yes.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
What went wrong?
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Keep me company.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Of course.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Yes, please.
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Thanks.
I'm not here.
You're so famous now.
They won't let you in without one.
You'd look naked without one.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
You never were...
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
This Zen master surfer.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Sure.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Warm them up.
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Someone else will be going in with you.
There's something else, Major...
He's not really my uncle.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
You've got a lot of nerve.
Yes.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
So do day jobs.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
You couldn't afford it.
What's your name, lover.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Always.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Occupational hazard?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
"Occupational hazard".
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
Was someone rude to you?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
I think it's exciting.
You did.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
What if I lose it?
You won't.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Oh, god, what?
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Have you lost your mind?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
In Beverly Hills?
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
I pray for that.
Go for the bucks.
Kit give me nothin'.
Oooh, I love those.
You'll like it fine.
They will serve salad.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
As you wish.
As you wish.
There will never be a need.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Gently!!
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
True!
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
DEATH FIRST!!
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
Morons.
Good. Then pour the wine.
Australia.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
An hour.
Have fun storming the castle.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
What are you saying?
"Honeymoon,
Oooooooops!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
What was I saying?
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
Double.  Double.  Double.
Shut up.
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Good.  I will make the preparations.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Always.
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Ta.  Ta.
Nietzche...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
Very early. Dawn.
No.
And when she left, she never came back.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
Money.
I don't believe it.  Do you?
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
All right.
In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
With the forty thousand dollars?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Is Mary... in trouble?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
An hour! Or less!
Who's he?
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Huh?
I'm glad we didn't.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
Is your time so empty?
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Good night.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Haven't any.
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
Shut up!
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
What--special autopsy?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
But where do the rats come in?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
He isn't here.
What did it say?
There's no child here.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
You would.
Why didn't you eat last night?
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
I'd love to, at any time.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
You mean he was colored?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
You give me a pain!
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Let it go.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Here's a wow.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Cry-baby?
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
Oh, is that what caused it?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
Yes.
Thanks.
Okay.
Like now?
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
What'd you do, Rose?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
I don't want to know...
Okay.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Well, yeah.
The girl strikes like a cobra.
Well, it's not very plain.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
Well... maybe...
No.
Yeah.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Then why does she act so dumb?
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Here comes Daddy.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Please do.
How goes it, darlin'?
What?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
All right, darlin'.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Is she all right?
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Over... my... dead... body!
Fine.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
You mean a farm?
What?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Nothing, Rose.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
You're so sweet.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I don't mind.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
Abe Lincoln...
Again.
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
No you can't.
Get ready.
Relax.
We should slow down.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Yeah.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
The booze.
Entertainers don't count.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
General Jim Beam, then.
Nope.
I'm here.  That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
That's not true.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Keep 'em busy.
Yeah.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
But I have no sister.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Yeah, sure.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
It'll work. It'll work.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
All right, hang on.
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Your Royal Highness.
Your father?
So, you have accepted the truth.
If that is your destiny.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yes.
Yes or no will do.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Yes.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Weiss.
No, don't do that.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
A decision had to be made.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Yes, I do.
It's okay.
I should leave.
The glasses... Please.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
I gotta go out for a while.
What're we going to do?
No... I can't!
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Why?
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
...Stop jivin'!
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
That's it.
Ya still light seventy.
...Fine.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Rocky.
What?
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Why?
More like thirty.
...Who'd ya fight?
Ain't they?
Here's the card?
Freak luck is a strange thing.
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Whatta you get outta this?
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Don't get mental, man.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
Ice skate.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
I got whiskey here.
Sure I like her.
You serve martinis, doncha?
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Shoulda guessed.
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
R.K. Maroon.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Ask her...
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Eddie, come on.
Doom.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Aren't you the lucky one...
Stop what?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Yeah, that's better.
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Romeo will answer it?
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my heel, I care not.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Hold Daughter!
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
Where is my Lady's lord?
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Ahhh!
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Well, what was yours?
Pink for flower.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Leaving...
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
And who are you?
How do we know that?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
From Interpol?
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Do you have the material?
He's company.
Of course.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Sent it where?
A post office box.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Don't cross me...
And you respect him.
How did you know?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Yeah.
I didn't expect that he would.
Not for long.
My way is better.
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
It's my job.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
You think?
I don't know...
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
Finish the job...
Nothing...
You better get some sleep, alright?
Gone.  Destroyed.
I'm sure.
I get the picture.
Don't lie to me!!!!
Seven thousand...
That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
That's not what I mean.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
And how do you figure we do that?
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
None of us like it!
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
What are you doing, Earl?
Denning was wearing a bug.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Has he?
How the hell did he find it?
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I love you Sally.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Did you say After Midnight?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Have I seen her?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
About what?
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Calm down --
Right behind you.
I think I am.
And what happened?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Two-hundred thousand!
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I'd like to see you try.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
That's right.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
And you ain't black!
I'm okay, you go.
Forget it.
What?
Why LA?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
You sound like that all the time.
No.  It was my singing.
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
She saved our lives.
It doesn't matter.
Yes.  We have heaven.
How was the sex?
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
No.  I'm going to find out.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
No problem.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
It's okay, I got lots more.
This money is evidence.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Shut up!
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Tell me about it.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
Did you make the plate?!
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
Yee-aww.
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Going into the restaurant.
What do you hear?
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
What's wrong with that?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Not to me. Never to me.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
You a cop or something?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
Yes.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
It's Griffin.
Griffin?  Where are you.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I'm not running.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
Thank you.
Got any last minute advice?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Of course.
Of course.
He's here!... He's here!
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
Why do YOU think she ran?
And you defending her?
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Tootaloo.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Maybe someday.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Highly suspect.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Of course.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I kissed him back.
Really?
Yup!
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
No.  It's my life.
That's good.
-- who's married to --
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
I love you.
Happy New Year.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
It was my mother's.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
Look!
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"I want to meet you..."
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Go home for the weekend.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
What?
Magic.
Hello.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Where's your mom?
I don't know --
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
You'll see.
It's Y. O. H.
But how am I going to get there?
No, I'm not, but --
English muffin.  How do you do it?
Bye bye blackbird.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Okay.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
Who is Annie?
You said we could go to New York.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Well...
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Hi.
You look good yourself.
He's good at it.
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
It never ends.
Yeah.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Who? A scab?
No, Estellita.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What's more important than sanitation?
Never... never... never!
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Yes.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
You know I don't think that.
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
You've got to help around the house!
How about in the house?
First rate, ain't it?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Everything go?
Colette ...
Therapy session is over.
Why?
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
It's Tom.
Guess it's our turn.
10%.  That's ...
Palmdale
He doesn't have one.
Yes, Jimmy
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
You don't trust me?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Yeah, dickhead.
When?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Who is it?
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
There's no motels around here.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
That is so unfair.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
The hell he didn't.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
It seemed appropriate.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
PUSH!
Maybe.
Since when have things been normal?
Three for three.
How about I go right, sir?
Bits and pieces.
And what about your own hand?
I think you're right, Keith.
You want me to take over?
Yes, sir.
But, sir...
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Twenty-four-five.
Pardon me?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Speak with my lawyer.
This evening is over.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
That's right.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
That's not even a scam.
See you tomorrow.
So, what's your point?
I already did.
Read it.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
I dream about it.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Oh yeah!
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I just had a phone call.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Goodnight.
Sit down.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Yeah?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Well, not monumentally.
Yeah
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Twisted?
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Mmmm.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
I'll see you there.  Bye.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
You're shaking.
It was wonderful.
Did you tell anybody?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
The guy with the Datsun?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
No way.
What?
Yeah.
How you doin', brother?
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
It's a beautiful city.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's bad business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
When?
I don't know.  Soon.
These people, my people, I want my people.
I just told you.
You're a good man.
Pistols?
What others?
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
More.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
No, no, what, what is it?
That doesn't work, sir.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
thought he was doing AA.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
What is it?
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
That's too bad.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I did that.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No, I don't.
No way.
Yeah.
You freakin?
Sid, you don't have to.
Let us decide that.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
He hates Oliver Stone.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
And Joel's pre-med.
Yeah, right.
Just in case...
Whatever.
What if your life depended on it?
Stay away from the cop.
I have to watch rehearsal.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Her old boyfriend?
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..it's really about family and tradition...
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We got free tickets.
Shush.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Do I?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
And who would that be?
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Is that a threat?
There's someone here who wants to help.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Just Jennifer.  And you.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
But you know who she was.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
What are you talking about?
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Huh, fine.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
I thought you wanted me here?
No I need to call you. Just you.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
No, it's not.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
I'm going... I'm going.
You know that's not true.
Oh Sidney...
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
What number are you trying to reach?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Guess.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Guess.
No... please.
NOOOO....
No it's not. It was Jason.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
Then what are you doing here?
Mind if I join you?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Sidney's father?
Yes, you doofus.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Drive by patrol.
You think he could still be in town?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
That's the original part.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Working, thank you.
Twice.
Don't come any closer.
The why'd the police let him go?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
There goes my chance with Sid.
The official term is "psychotic".
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Thanks, Tatum.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Bye.
He was there, Tatum.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Announcing what?
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
What are you talking about?
Where was the girl?
What the hell's going on?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Shut up!
What the fuck is going on?
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Totally unrelated victims.
Okay.  But, what?
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
The fingerprints.
We'll tag along.
Who pays the rent on time.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
I don't.  Neither do you.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
We have probable cause now.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
I don't see anything.
I want to have children.  It's just...
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
Crime of passion.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
In that case, give the boys room...
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Now mount up, son...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
You got it with you?
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
He just couldn't wait...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Cut it out, will ya...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
Where?
But couldn't you...?
You'll never get away from me!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Cherry-red Tears.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
What are you talking about-
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
But what is the truth?
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
It's good.
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Lady?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Tomorrow.
Wait!  Will you desist!
Twenty pounds on delivery
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
The title?
Ned is wrong for it.
Done.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Most interesting.
No, no. You have a wife, children
yet cannot love nor write it.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
That's me.
Put his feet in.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
She is always Aphrodite.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Wonderful, wonderful.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
This is a different one.
"Is the day so young?"
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Of love?"
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
I am not so well-born.
Oh, but they can!
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
"Madam!"
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"She speaks.
Is she obedient?
I'll be damned if you are!
I am.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
There is.
There is time. It is still dark.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
You lie.
I was the more deceived.
You cannot marry Wessex!
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Nor you for me.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
She sings too?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
Serve.
I was trying to educate you.
I don't have time.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I can't do it.
Take his legs.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
Not eating what?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I don't know.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Sorry to waste your time.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
And you like it?
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
You see, they don't really know me.
Yes.
I'm just looking.
What?
And now you tell me.
Who?
What's he doing here?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
We could put it somewhere.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Alex.
That wasn't a question.
Would you like to talk about it?
Two hundred pounds.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Right here?
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
You get the job done.
That guy, the one that died.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
That sounds fine.
Or a fake?
Chicken salad, Devra!
That kid... the hairdresser.
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
What are you talking about?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Yeah, I think so.
Gee, that's very serious...
Wow.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
You're looking great, baby.
Whatever you say.
What about?
Hello, George.
Uh-uh.
Her?
You think that's funny, don't you?
Yeah.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Right.
How is she?
I went to school with her husband.
You do know what money's like these days.
I've got heads here, Norman.
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
What's wrong?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Did I what?
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- what guy?
You were great.
-- sure.
Not me, pal.
-- we are?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
No, man.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Wanda...
Oh yeah?
Wash her.
I don't know if you don't know --
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- why did you come in today?
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
Yeah, baby.
Of course I like children.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Hello.
How did it go at the bank?
Go where?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
I want your feelings about it.
What?
... Okay...
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
Bullshit.
George...
Please!... that's not like you.
Stop it.
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
Oh yeah?
I know it, I know it.
I don't know what to...
-- yeah?
Well, what?
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
Well, I don't know.
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.

Come on by.
No you won't.
What do you mean?
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Sid.
Then you were talking to him.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Jackie, what're you doing?
Don't be silly.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Jackie --
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- Yesss?
But why Egypt?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Johnny!
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
That's fine --
-- just wonderful.
No... how long did you say?
No.
Thanks for coming by.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Do you like this hotel?
No, Dad.
Good.
No.
How does he tell you things?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Okay...oh!
Yes?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
To my stomach.
Thank you.
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
Fine.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Who?
All right, sir.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
I'm a Wendy.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
What time is it?
Yes.
No, nothing at all.
Why?
I just want to go back to my room.
Wendy give me the bat.
Yes?
can of itself be a problem.
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
How do you do?
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
What's that?
Well... it is his third.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
What?
No.
I will- be good, kids.
Perhaps.
You know what we're saying!
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
You know it.
Today was the deadline, Vince.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
You pig!
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Yes, Betty?
Oh my! 
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Right.
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Five a.m.?
A novice.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
You watch yourself!
Honey.
Keep moving!
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Again?
What did He say?
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
And whom would you call?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
But -- why?
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Don't push it.
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
Get a stenographer.
Okay -- no limo.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
Nuns?
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Yeah, like what?
Hail, Mary.
But -- wait.
It's a bluff, Vince.
Which one!
We're losing it.
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Which convent was that, Sister?
It's better than ice cream.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Many have.
You must have missed your mark.
A diseased monster.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
I did not ask you to, did I?
Should we go back?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
He has proposed to me twice.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
They have done nothing of the sort.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What did he say, Katrina?
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She is guilty.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
Yeah, me too.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
Well, what did you want?
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
That might be better than this.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
I'll be back in a little bit then.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
I know Albert. We're friends.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Why'd you live there?
How come?
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Hit was right thoughty of her.
All right then.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
What do you mean?
So it died when it come out?
You will? For sure?
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Yes sir.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
I want to come back and stay here.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
My history.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
We sure like havin' you.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
And what are you, his chaperone?
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Not an easy book.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What happened?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
What's the difference?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
The Queen of England?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Where to?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Why don't you open it and find out?
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Sure thing. See you later.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
You mean Rashid?
I just want to know where he is.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Hi there, little brother.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Appreciation for what?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
You don't really want to know.
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
The inspiration.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
His only copy?
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
And started to run.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Is that your third question?
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Why not?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
You're right.  I better use two.
I think you like learning.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Not in those words.
I can't speak for him.
Why?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Hey, she's ticklish!
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Where were you guys?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Yeah.  Why?
Of course I am.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Hey, Joe!
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Tore off one of my chests.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
This happens to me all the time in public.
With ME?
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
I'll say.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'm not that sick.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Yeah - Josephine.
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
What's the big idea?
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
You invest in shows?
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
And I can never have children.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
We won't breathe a word.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
It's three weeks in Florida -
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
It's not the backs that worry me.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Me?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
You are?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Not at all.
Saxophone player?
Not at all.
You have a yacht?
No, my flag steward.
For your own amusement?
You're society girls?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
What theory?
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Why?
You collect shells?
If it's at all possible -
What?
Guess!
They repealed Prohibition?
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
It's the thought that counts.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
What is it?
Completely.
They just sort of leave me cold.
That makes me feel just awful.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
What is it?
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Did you have a nice time?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
You're not?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I never join nothin'.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Big joke!
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
What for?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Still--
Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Mom, please.
You are taking the piss?
No, thats not it.
No.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Brilliant.
Kat.
You have feet?
Both.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Oh, no.
Okay.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
...but its getting there. 
At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Yes, Miss Johnson...
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Yes, sir...
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
He can't get up, Mama!
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
I'll walk...
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
Mornin'...
Is there something I can do to help you?
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Will they give him a trial?
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
About what?
Sheet!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
The N word?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Mph rm.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
Uhh... I don't know.
Uhh... Bacon.
You bastards!!
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Excuse me?
Oh, thank you.
I did nothing to the monitors.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
10-4 good buddy.
Over and out!
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Just considering our options... sir.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Sure.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
What?  What are you talking about?
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
What are you going to do about it?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
The pin machine?
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Are you guys bruddas?
I hate fuckin' opera.
- canker sore.
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
I'd buy it!
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Wish me luck.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Who gave it to you?
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I'm your blood.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
I'm getting to like it here.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Buzz Fazeli.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
What did you do to Buzz?
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Who's there?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
You still got the touch Junior.
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
I'm a bowler.
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Uh...over easy.
What does he do?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
It's a vicious cycle.
Not while I'm in training.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
We'll get into that later.
Plan C...  ...is me.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
It's Junior, isn't it.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
I'm not here to bowl.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
It's burning...
I can't...
Yeah.  I heard you.
What do we use for defense?
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
That's our reserve air.
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Anything else?
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
When was this?
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
-- and then brought her down here --
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
How do you mean, strange?
She's not gonna know, sir.
To what?
Internal power.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Because when we get down there --
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
Yeah, it was awful.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
So what?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
Still clear.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
The refridgerator.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
You think, in the sphere --
Valdomet.
How do you spell it?
Beth --
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
I'm feeling better.
You tell me.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
No, he can't.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Hear what?
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
It doesn't make any sense.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Another attack?
Like what?  I'm not --
Is it coming from our own computer?
Look, would you --
To what?
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
I don't follow you.
You remember opening the door?
Then explain it to me.
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You don't remember that?
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What is it, Harry?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Please.  It must have flown here --
The others, sir?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
Fear is their greatest weapon.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
You saw through me?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
That's where my father was killed.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
He's bluffing...
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Was this trip really necessary?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Are you safe?
Something... I've got...you don't.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Not enough, I guess.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
You and me, huh ?
Who ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
How do I know if this is love ?
I don't even know if you're my girl.
You're right. Let's never stop...
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
What happened to your eye ?
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Courage, I guess.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Yeah, that's right.
Move out.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Departure angle.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Mr Decker....
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Decker....!
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Mr. Decker... ?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
The point... 
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
To you, sir?
Helm ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
I have one, but they lost it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
I beg your pardon?
You quit.
I quit the movie.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
It's in your play.
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
No, no, I see...
Yes...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Surest thing you know.
...that.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<u>Yes</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
I...
What are you doing down there?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
One moment.
You believe that?
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
I can't get it to come out right.
It used to be the Old Mill.
Where you going?
What?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Is it...
Gosh, you look nice.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
That's something a man could do...?
Yeah, you?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
I saw...
I'm going to tell the truth.
Ten thousand dollars.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Who is this person that you've found?
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
And I need a drink.
Fifteen hands.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Sure, what have you got?
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
I...
I swear that that woman in my room...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
What I...
You can go...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Everybody needs a hob...
I think he's moved...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I like you, too.
But not that <u>way</u>...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
...we had a script conference...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
Is...Is the Movie!
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
The minute I read that script I said...
He treated me as if I were a child...
Yes.
Why not?
-- she's got 'religion.'
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
Arrest him.
Later for you, pal.
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
How about that.
A witness to what...?
The writer.
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I know you do.
Why?
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
So be it.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I didn't say anything to them.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
And we're glad to have you here...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...the city council...
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
That will never happen.
Why does Rachel scream?
...why do you think?
And...?
I'll miss you so much.
This is my house too!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
In high school.
Don't take my picture!
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
You have the WORST flu since...
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
No!  I have to get there.
Before you.
Oh.
So where are you?
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Remarried.  There is no move.
Something's up wi...
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
To make it easier for them or you?
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
We don't have any coffee.
<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Is that what he told you?
And I'm going to win.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Maybe he's gay.
What if he is?
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Must've been hard being poor.
Speak English.
My Jesus
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Fine.
Huh?
You mean, again?
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Any books you like to read for fun?
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I hate reading.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Yeah.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Why? Are we going dancing?
Who's got matches?
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
What do you think?
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
What happened?
You're talking about committing suicide!
Are you going to kill us?
Yes, you should.
What do you mean?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
What!
There's enough in one vial...
Possibly some coffee?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
You mean you'll tell us his name???
See!  See, I told you.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
So what?
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
What kind of trouble?
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
How much soda, sir.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
I see.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
But we can't communicate with the base.
Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Have you tried the recall again?
General, stick to the point, please.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Lothar, take your checks now.
I don't think so.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Yeah?
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Quentin, how's your gear?
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Yeah.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Hey, you said you did a video?
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Yeah.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
She's dead?
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Really?
Oh, you were in the band?
Yeah.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
In what way?
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Oh, So what about her?
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Hi.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Mm-mm.
Let's see.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Yeah?
Always two-fifty, my friend.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Just put it down.
I gave it to you.
Look, look, just get off my property.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Yeah.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
You know what I'm saying?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Don't do that, man, okay?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Your manager?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
You just became a statistic!
Positive.
And they get caught!
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Trix...
You sure I'm not fat?
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Don't use big bills!
Bullets.
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Definitely old.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Why, you sweet kid.
Thank you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
What about all those ideas you had?
What has Artie to do with it.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
What happened?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Come on, Joe.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Get out.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Or teach it a better tune.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
I am not afraid.  Read it!
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I don't care.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
What scene?
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
This is the right day.
Where are your...?
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
Why do you say that?
Yes, I am, Norma.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
No, they don't.
That isn't true! Max?
Go on in.
Madame is waiting.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
What?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Frankly, no.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
You know better than to interrupt me.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
What is it?
No, a super girl.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Maybe it was just an accident.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Tell me where I can find her.
We can't do that.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Well...I guess one is all right.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Like turning off a light.
I'm not mad at you.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Well, there's several ways to go .
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
They think I have a concussion.
I could force you.
Supergirl?
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
What about my proposal?
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
The scoop of the year!
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Must've been a defective puck.
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
It was just a trim.
I don't scare that easily.
For what?
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
What? Palace? Hardly.
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Mr. Roebush?
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
I didn't --
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, thanks.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Mom and I do this all the time.
Mmmmm . . .
Gus Gorman.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
First paycheck?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Tell me more...
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Stone mutha.
Can you do that?
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
You just did, with that great dinner.
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Why do I have to do this?
Where's the handle?
Today coffee----
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
I do?
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Lois, you're amazing.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Never closed my eyes.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
You're not selfish at all.
What??
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Genius!  --  Lex.
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
Sensible enough.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Oh! That black box in our cell?

Constantly.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
North. Keep going North!
It will. Starting with your own.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
		DELETE IN CUTTING
Stay. I will come to you.
Yes?
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Who?
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
But he's never there.
Something . . . wonderful.
Our other dinner guest.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
Destiny.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
He's thirty-five years old.
One of them should've been you.
I've been on the job.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know.
North. It's north
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
I read the article.
La de da da...
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
I knew you'd hit me.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
-- as we will be.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
No! You couldn't imagine -
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
195 pounds.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
It's a Twinkie, boss.
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Alison Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
What happened?
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Case?
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
Billy, please.  The children.
Say hello for me.
It does concern me.
Because it's what we have to do.
C'mon, you know that won't...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
I did.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
Away from your crazy Mom.
What happened to summer?
It's interesting.
What's a ditty again?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
So he was mean?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
What do they do?
Crafts?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Is there shrimp on it?
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
No.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Yes.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
You could see the speedometer?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Now don't kid a kidder.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
I'll listen one more minute.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
- He's got them on him.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
But what?
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Now listen to me very carefully.
No one must follow your work.
Let me try mine.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
What?
No shit?
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
But I promised your mother.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Some.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
Three months.
I can't do this. It's not right.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
How come?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
How?
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
I wish to say something.
Then you are wrong.
Von der Null?
That's an outrageous lie!
I have no idea.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
What?
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
So. You wanted to see me.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
One of your people told me.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
Come to the office, please.
Can you handle it?
Wrong.
You must have a girlfriend.
Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
About what?
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Not possible.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
No.  Never.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Of course.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Like shit, boss.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
Now, look...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
It was an accident.
You should be.
Home.
Why not?
My hero.  Let's go.
Yes... well...
Why... ?
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Can we talk?
Where'd you get this?
Okay.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas...
Get us out!
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Let me show you...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Studied acting, I assume?
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
I redecorated.  What about you?
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
It doesn't matter...
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Yes.
And, they didn't take that watch?
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Yes.
Oh, here we go...
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
It was a different floor then...
Guess!
Didn't I give you two?
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Goodnight then.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
Why are you following me?
Don't ask.
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Yeah.
Why?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
Yeah.
You want company?
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
That?  That's Hill House.
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
It's all I could afford.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Oh, god.
Italian.
I sure hope so.
Not bad.
Where do we go?
There's been some trouble downtown.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
What did you tell them.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
No reason.
Terry Valentine.
Y'what?
Where abouts?
Did Jenny know?
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Huh?
No one else is even here yet.
Not her brand.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
That's not what I heard.
Modelling.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
He give me your address.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
Why not.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
Overnight.  What about just now?
Black market during the war.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
You sure?
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
No rest for the wicked.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
The L.A.P.D.
So what.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
You know I don't live with him.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Tell me.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Hello, Tony.
Hello, Birdy.
Oh, Mr Crane--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
It's OK...
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
How's business, Dave?
How much to they want, Dave?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
But it's...
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Congratulations, Gina.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
OK. Boy. Jesus!
He a good man?
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Huh?
OK.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
That's very generous.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Hello, Walter.
No thanks, I--
Hello.
Not an owner.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
His eyes are open.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Let's go!
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
Like hell!
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
I wouldn't be so sure.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Big as a house.
Like this.
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
What's that?
How about lunch?
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
How did you know that?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
How?
The answer's right in front of us.
<i>Fiji.</i>
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
It's just a matter of time.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Amnesia.
Certainly a nomination.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
I'm the creator.
The memory of who?
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
That's right.  Lauren.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
Who?
I've got to show you something.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
What's that?
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I'm not hungry.
--we need more charcoal.
You're not FBI agents.
Yup.
Sorry. Don't have one.
Brought on by what?
Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Is it an emergency?
There are complications.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
You got some kind of business with him?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
Have you examined them?
I know the name. Why?
Who sent you?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
What killed those men?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
What did it look like?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
How's that?
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
No you didn't.
I just did. You're buying.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
You're... quitting?
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
And you're looking for?
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
What did you find?
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What did you find?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
Come on!
I don't know.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
He's come and gone.
Is she alive?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Shush.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
She said convincingly.
No.  No.
Baked in a pie.
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
Yep.  Eloped.
It doesn't matter...
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
No.
Dr. Kent.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
What else do we do?!
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Considering where I've been...
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
He has a little dog.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Mmmm.
They're forged.
Silly looking bunch.
In German?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
I'm so sorry.
What are you going to do?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
He liked to laugh.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
How do you know?
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
His.
Thank you.
That's the reason.
No.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
I can't. He disappeared...
I see.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Here?
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Just take it, OK.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
I'm sorry.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Where did you lose it?
Uh-huh.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
They don't have extermination camps.
What??
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
Disease? What disease?
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
You want it to be an event.
Are they still together?
Then how come you're talking to me?
Oh, yeah... 
That's stupid.
Where are they?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Why should I submit?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Danny, what about the Jews?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Why would Nadelman lie?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
I don't think you know what you are.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
You're lying.
It's German.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Fine.
Isn't it true?
The mother.
Christ...
You said they didn't have night guards.
Why? Why would she?
Are you an artist?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Do I give a shit?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Dennis Leary.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
What?
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
No.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
But your man isn't quite a God!
Of course.
What d'you mean?
The documents are forged.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
You know each other?
Yes.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
I think I'll have a coffee.
I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
I won't, I swear.
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
The rules are the rules.
And... does the voice come back?
What room have you got?
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
What?
Get in the car!
... Yes.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Who?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
I don't know, I just feel it.
Why?
I'm still here.
... Not at all.
I didn't dive.
You want to lie down for a while?
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
C'mon follow me.
Yeah, no kidding.
Sure. Why not.
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Mazel Tov!
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Mmmyes.
It don't look like a leopard to me.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Let me see it 
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Hey  I'm over here.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Thanks, Sheriff.
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
Don't be soft.
And did you find the leopard?
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
You. Us.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Have you got a pen?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Have you finished?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
...You-you spoke to him?
I dont.
...Were turning in circles.
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
I know where to look.
Im sure Ill find a way.
A criminal?
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
What about your friendly cop?
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks Im obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But hes a good guy. Hell listen to you. He wont turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
You... Fuck you!
No... No...  I swear...
Whats the Ambassador?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Your secretary, huh!
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Recommended?
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
You seem very sure about that.
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Im afraid I dont understand.
I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Im sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldnt let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until youre told otherwise.  And for what its worth, I wouldnt try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. Id sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Alors quoi?
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
Then why dont you reach him?
If he had, youd be dead.
Are they still operative?
Do you think I could have some water?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
Jeanne, no...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
You make it sound so simple...
Tell the king to give me more men.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
But that was her order!
No...
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
No, I... I held it up to...
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
Performing a miracle.
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
The voice was in your cell?
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
Thanks be to God.
I'm... I'm not the king...
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
Good.  Where are the English?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Not yet.
Yes, it's a miracle.
Damn right!
Yes.  We can pray.
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Jeanne... we're not enough...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Jeanne, look behind you.
To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
Don't swear...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
Yes... lots of things!
What signs?
Really?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I agree...
Are you going to leave me too?
Let's see.
Is that bad?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
What... does he... look like?
And what does he say to you?
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Dorota.
How will we sleep?
I'll be fine.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
What's happened?
Tough luck.
I've no money.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
We use what?
Just shut up.
Hungry.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
But I want to help, I want to.
Toilets?
Can you help? I've no money...
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
We're getting out.
It will be very dramatic.
To be deaf?
There is something to be said for silence
And where did they get married?
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
What are they?
He chopped it off
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
A piano?
Hello.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
All of it.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
We cleared 22 here.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Hackers.
Yes sir.
What do ya want the others to get?
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Yeh, it was easy.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
You wanta wait for your share?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Where you goin'?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
All right, when?
Yeh, he knows that.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
Why don't ya then.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
No.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
And if it isn't?
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Don't cry.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
There!
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Macaulay.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
You see how much we have to say.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
He's a brave man.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Yes... yes.
That woman!
Was there much blood?
We were looking for this bird.
You mean about that gun?
Man to man, I'm not.
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
This is enough for me.
He did!
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Let him have his say out.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
Chris!
Why, you said...
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Yes?
Never mind.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
That last Martini.
What are you going to do with it?
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Oh take it!  Please take it!
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
But Wynant --- ?
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
What are you going to do?
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
What things made you so sure?
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi...
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Home?
You did.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
You just go when I say go.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
Picks up again just on the other side.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
You don't know he isn't.
Wes--
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Knock it off!
No you're not.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
Invest it.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
They're not going to--
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
Let's go.
I got that...sir.
Mine.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Makes two of us.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
What?
I could use some recon photos too.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
I thought it would be good to know.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
What?
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
You want to crawl, crawl.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Correct.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
Don't be so sure.
Don't take anything.
But...you...
It's the end.
What?
THX and me.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
What's going on?
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
No......  She's dead THX........
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
Now wait just a fucking-
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Only once, at Redstone.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
You don't have to talk about it.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
Off the scale.
Reilly! He's loaded!
What kind of bomb was it?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
In a moment.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
No.
Constantinople?
You've never been in Constantinople?
You're looking fine, Major.
Nice suit.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
But not now.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just call me Gaston.
No, Captain, I tell you--
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Five, seven, and nine--
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Not particularly.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
The same thing.
Then a little nap--
Precisely.
Any minute I want!
I <u>believe</u> you.
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Goodbye ... 
Yes--uh--
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Naturally not!
Ever had a romance with a crook?
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Yes, I saw it--but--
An hour, two at most.
Get that outta my face.
Rush her.
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
She knows.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
Good. Settled then.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
Worse I'm afraid.
So don't marry him.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Jack, I --
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
Right.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
That's enough.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Just tell us what you can --
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
No-o!
Fine--I'll be glad to.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
Yes--
Good-by.
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Brett is the name.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Yes?
Don't rub it in.
Sooner it you like.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
You said it! How about a little action?
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
What is it?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Good night!
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Knots!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Yeah--
Yes!
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Because I was yellow, I guess--
I sincerely hope so--
"Smooth's" the word.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Maybe even my destiny.
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
Enough?  Never.
Better.
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
How you feelin', Doc?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
There's no reasoning with him.
No.
Colorado's closer
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Where do you get these questions?
Just answer.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Wyatt...
You get lonely?
So he can tell the story.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Yeah?
That didn't sound like thunder.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
None of my business, Fred.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
We'll see about that.
What about the gold?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Do you?
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
Let's take a look at the body.
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
She married a hockey player.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Who knows? Fog, night...
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Depends what number you write.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Trust me.
... We have time for that?
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Now.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
It doesn't quite add up.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
You disappoint me, Number Three.
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Yes.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Oh here we go with that.
They're too big.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Why in the h...
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
You're always taking his side.
No, I'm too hot now.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Well, I would appreciate that.
Everything these days is made overseas.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Rocky!  The ramp!
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
No.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Murderer!
Look!  Janie!
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
All the time.
Nothing is left but us.
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
I can't do that.
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
This is different.
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Barbara --
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Is this bad for him?
What's up?
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
Sixteen
Yes.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Just watch.
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
We can protect you.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
No.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
A small thing.  Nothing really.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Christ.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
Holding hands?
Unless you get caught.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Do you recall the school motto?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Spud, they're my sheets.
Aye.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Cheers.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
The park?
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
What about The Untouchables?
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Cut it out.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
That's tough.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
Your usual table, sir?
Why, thank you.
Sure.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
It's fresh air.
Went ballistic?
Pavel.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
I've always known... I'll die alone.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Yes.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
I cannot be certain.
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Be one with the horse.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
How do you know?
He did have pointed ears.
Is what possible?
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
Not possible. You were never alone.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
No conditions.

"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
I hide no pain.
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
Sybok, we must find a way...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
I don't get it.
You haven't told him?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
What -- ?
Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Right on the money!
Not a chance.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
Greetings, program...
Yeah, I... oops!
Wrote the...?
Shhhhh.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
As long as it gets us out of here
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Where are you off to young lady?
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Why?
Will you just open the door!					*
Stay on him.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
Son of a bitch!
What're you talking about?  We have that.
He could be working her to get to you.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
No!  Never!
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Yes, sir.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
What'd you do, honey?
No.
What did you need?
God, you have great legs.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Worse than Cairo?							*
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
You can trust me completely.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
Yes.  Now go.
His wife.
Hello, Alabama.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
What did he do to Arlene?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
You will?
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
I heard that.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Naw naw!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Can you live with it?
Yeah.
Tomorrow.
Has he gotten his mail today?
You goin' out?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Elliot.
Where?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
What are we gonna see?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
I can see what you mean.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
I can, but I don't.
What makes you think I would do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
No shit?
Sure.
Uh-huh.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Could we try it now?
Uh-huh.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
No way, Jos.
Yeah, I live here.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Well, you go down Beechwood...
Donowitz, he said.
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Uh, what?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
So that...???
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
July.
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
What?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
Jeffrey Mason?
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
What's the matter with your leg?
No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Flowers!  What flowers?
What's that mean?
What are you talking about???
You know -- your plan.
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
What...???
You do know me.  You helped me once.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
I'll be right here...just in case.
I said I was sorry.
All right, old man.  Christ.
Yeah, yeah.
Christ!
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
What do you want for free?
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
You Harlin?
Yep.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Two-hundred.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
It is morning.
I want my car.
You got the money?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yes.  Yes it is.
What do you want?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
You're not from around here, are you?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Beautiful?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Did you ever?
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You could just leave him.
Whatever it takes.
Have you ever been there before?
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
From?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
There has to be!
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
We're going all the way.  Together.
Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
Not me.  Us.
What?
He was going to--
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
You killed a man for no reason!
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
It's . . . it's locked.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Like you don't know.
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
Just ran into a little trouble.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I do.
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a mad man.
You meant it.
What makes you say that?
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
You know what I mean.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
SHUT UP!
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Jake--
It's the truth, Jake.
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
Christ, Jake, please--
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
Not from where I stand.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Got any requests?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
What happened?
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
No!
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Say, what happened to your hand?
Would I what?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Got any requests?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Will you shut up!
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
No! No police.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Where you headed?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Like you.
Beautiful?
And what would that be?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
How do you know he's still not here?
Don't feel like nothing.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I'm not sailing his boat.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
No! No! Please!
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
What about Jeb?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Are you for real?
You're skill.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
One last question.
I won't make any noise.
I mean if you knew karate?
Know what?
Is that right?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
I fined 'em instead.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
That much, huh?
What's your name?
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Then... what?
N-no, sir?
Huh?
No.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
You don't recollect!
I got him.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
He's in there.
Yeah.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
You ain't shot.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
You sure you ain't armed?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
You ain't like that no more.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
Thought you was followin' me.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Yeah?
Hell, yeah.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
We'll make it.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
What about Redfoot?
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
I shivved him.
Business or personal?
Who is he?
What'the fuck is that?
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
What happened?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
Immunity.
Abrams...
... tell me about this case.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
What is the truth?
What does it mean?
Yes.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
...We did everything we could...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
That's not my handwriting.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
No.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I'm sure you would.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Ready, your Honor.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Mr. Alito, please.
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Pardon?
And what are you?  A cop?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe what?
What happened...?
I've got to work.
You're talking like a drunk.
And what makes you so tough?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
No...no...
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
...I have to stand up for her...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What difference can that make...? All right...
The 'History'...?
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
... I understand ...
... I understand ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
In New York?
Yes.
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes.
I did.
Yes.
Yes.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.
Should I?
Yes.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
Then?
No.
No.
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
And when she goes to those places...
I -- I --
Did she hurt herself?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
You won't have to.
Who you are --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
But you haven't lived here long.
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
No, it's not right.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Ah, no!
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
But why? Why here?
Madeleine died here.
Scottie --
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Do you remember where you were?
Where were you?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No... it's wrong.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
You've nothing to apologize for.
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Yes...
Why did you jump?
Would you know the room?
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
No, never!
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
Madeleine --
Madeleine!!
Please answer my question.
How long has she had the room?
It wasn't your fault.
It's where you belong.
Three whole weeks.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Do you know him well?
Nothing to tell.
You haven't told me everything.
Around.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Oh?
Naturally.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
Name one.
I don't have to...
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
You want to hear me out?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Sure, why not.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
That is absolutely not true.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Don't talk to me about character.
Any time fat boy!
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
I know...
Where is she?
Fish?
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
I'm talking about prayer.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Hear what?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Okay fine.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
I never heard that.
You have a King fantasy.
Israel doesn't have a King.
We're not goosed.
Government cutbacks.
The wedding cake check?
Sent it.
Photographer?
You forgot the tent?
Why?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Are we going to do this again?
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
He is.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
It's vile!
Of course.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Yeah. Nesting.
I'll see you tomorrow...
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
What!
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Do you love me?
Call the police.
It's too late.
What does that mean?
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Did she believe you?
A move?
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
Okay boys, smile!
Take your time. I wish I had.
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Thank you, Uncle.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
A black bull!
You little liar! Get out of here!
But, miss ...
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Today, a good girl.
Me? What did I do?
Whatever.
But only you will know he's not human.
What about them?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Then I guess we're even.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
This is supposed to be years away.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
Enough!
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
I'm still working on it.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I am impressed.
She's beautiful, you know?
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Enjoying yourself?
Start of what?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
You're not capable of it.
Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
My guess is dead.
I couldn't tell you.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Where did you plant the C-4?!
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
For Schumann.
No, this is great.
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
...they sound what?
<u>Who</u>?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
We'll be back tonight.
Due in Nashville.
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
War's over, Pal. 
Gloria -- sell the House.  
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
...what is this?
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
What do you think would hold it off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
I never won an Oscar.
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
...it's a Teaser!
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
They got him standing by.
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
All the greater accomplishment.
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...<u>Jaws</u>.  You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...
What guards Us Against Canada...?
...what is this?
Surest thing you know.
The hats.
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
...for the beans, yes...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
What was that?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Okay.
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Excuse me sir.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
What does that mean?
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Break it.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
And what do you want?
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Get the hell out!
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Old values. Buy.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
It's over you, Gordon.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
He did?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
What?  Tony and China, together?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Right.
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
I know that.
No, he wouldn't.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
Do you really think so?
No.
You're joking.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
You think that'll help?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
That's not...It's not like that.
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
Um...sure.
No.  No, I don't.
No, I don't.
Please leave me alone.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
He was so pissed.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
Well good.  So you're human.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Jody--
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
M-E...
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Jody, she's alive.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
All of us.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Like what?
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
You know what I mean.
You are...
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Hurry...
No, no.  It's fine.
In the house.  I was scared.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
You know what that does to me.
I'm so sorry.
Did you tell her?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Shhhh.
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
When?
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
I will NOT.
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
You should have tried harder.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
What?
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Claire...
I'm cooking you dinner.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Two what...?
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Come.  There is a lot to read
What are you talk---
He made that quite clear, yes.
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
Eighty million doll --- ?
The lamplight.  That's all.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
You - are - a - murderer.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
It is from love.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
I know.    you are my son -
Rowan...
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
Mad. for each other.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
- a witch.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Dropped it.
That's not funny.
Talking to me dear...?
Go ahead.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
No she didn't...
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
You've killed but you're not a killer
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Why should I?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
Nothing could be better...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Yes - I suppose so...
No - I'll have you after
Yes I can...
Get out...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
No worries
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Yeah, whatever.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We miss you. We miss our son.
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
I understand.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
My room?
You want it in writing?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
I didn't forget.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Really? You wanna write about me?
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
You're amazing.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
What about you?
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
Like what?
Forget the store. Think big.
I'm warning you.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
I do?
Why, look who's here.
Really? You'd do that for me?
You think we should be more open minded?
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
I'm just a messenger.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
This is insane.
Kelly.
About Suzie?
She still work there?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Back to the land of grownups.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
You have someplace to be?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Where's this coming from?
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Your Honor... Please...
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
What brain?
Whichever one I want.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
No thanks to you.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
About six and a half million dollars.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
There's nothing for them to get.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
That's cop bullshit.
You, Kelly, Sam.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Are you mad at me?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
In the next two minutes?
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
You tell me.
Would that include me?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
No, sir... just a businessman.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
The first.
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
You're not going to use it, are you?
You managed alright.
Not today, Willow.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
Why not?
I'm not going to let this baby die.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Why.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Farmer.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
Who?
Want me to carry Elora?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
Watch it!
Ahhh!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
That's all I ever wanted!
What's the magician's weapon?
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Me neither!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Here.  Hold her.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
The sorceress.
Maybe milking.
Just do it!
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Sure have, Sam.
Just us.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
You have no right to keep us here.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Aren't you? After today?
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
I didn't even know about it.
It won't happen again.
I'm coming.
Make that 1790.
You'd lie to protect him.
But... if you had to guess?
Oh.
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Lean on him.
All right, where is he?
My son is out there!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Yes, darling.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Is morally, ethic'ly
You'll be hist...
Oh ....
I don't believe you!
Goodbye, folks!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh --
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Did I scare you?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
You're going to see a Wizard?
To Oz?
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Here -- here --
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Ah --
What's the matter?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
What was that?
Yes, you.
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
NO!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
Yes -- ....
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
The King pipeline.
Who?
The worm on the hook again.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
How long has he been with you?
Youre not going to.
No. Youll be safe here.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
Oh James.
You, of course. I need some information.
I thought you were the one in her business.
Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
Bond!
Please.
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
What?!
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Washington?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Mm hmm.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
You're the only human being I care for.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
And what if youre wrong?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
His . . . whatever.
Laurie --
. . . What??
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Coward.  Giving up.
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Am I free to go?
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
What do I get out of it?
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
What do you get if you finish?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You're serious?
Why you dogging me up?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
How?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
