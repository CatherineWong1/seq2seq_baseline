The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
But
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
In 9th.  For a month
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Why didn't you tell me?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Away.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Are you lost?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
I didn't have a choice.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Pick you up Friday, then
You hate me don't you?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not a big talker, are you?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
Why'd you let him get to you?
Kat! Wake up!
Maybe.
Fallacy.
Hearsay.
It wasn't like that.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
No, Daddy.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Hi.
You think?
Kat a fan, too?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
You can see for yourself.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
You don't usually ask.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
What does he say?
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
... and also to bring medicine.
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
How can you be so certain?
I knew you would.
May I speak freely?
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
He must be replaced.
What about Oleg?
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Now I become custody of police department?
Are you married?
Divorced.
So...the station is empty?
No.
What are you asking me?
Is he your boyfriend?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Chief - mind if I take her?
End my career?
But Chief?  Over this??
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Two heads.
You thirsty?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Yeah.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
That's good.
Okay.
So what's unique?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Did you hear what I said?
Don't speak Russian!
Turn that fucking thing off!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Credit?
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
Well, he...
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
What are you gonna do?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Your doctor?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Sure, what is it?
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two more.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I'm having a party tomorrow.
How is gregor?
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
We eat when I say we eat.
Well?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
Half a million.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
That was quick.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Yeah?
I lost them, that's what happened.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
That's what you say, Cates...
Doesn't look like it.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
How would you know?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
When?
Let her go.
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
I brought the girl remember?
He's a she!
You noticed...
They all like this in your family, father?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
How do I look?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Other than that... You all right?
Hello?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
What mission?
Just one... why me?
And the third one?
Why not?
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Apipoussan?
I'm so very sad.
I told you not to read all that crap!
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Been here long?
It's not?
Actually only one cell survived..
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Is that better?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Okay, I believe you.
I love you.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Snuff?
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
What?
Who is this.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
What the fuck do you want from me?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Look, you cocksucker...
I'm listening.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Give me the film.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
How long you been working there?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
How old are you?
Where are your parents?
Specialty product.
What's this?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
My condolences.
You told me to look, so I looked.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
Are you religious?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Rick...I can't.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Then you saw him, too?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
What the hell was that?
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
About Freddy?
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Feeling better now?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
I've got to go.
I thought about that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
It's okay.
My father!  He's not - ?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
'Us?'
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Course and speed?
The frogmen?
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Now they feel it...down below.
As we near the Pole...
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Yeah. I know about that.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
This way.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
No brag. Just fact.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Like you and Gordon?
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
I want to go home.
Fuck you.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Okay. She's fine.
Yeah.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
What way?
I know your parents.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Can --?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
What?
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
His office. You mean my old office.
Sleeping.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Where's Ma?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Not particularly.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Yes dear?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
It's cut.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
The rest of the secret service?
why did they do that?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
We're not going to make it.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
What's going on?
But...
Thank you for calling the white House...
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Oveur.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
I'd use the word insane.
Ted!
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Negative.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Don't try to stop me!
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Thank you. Cream?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
But if you'll just give me...
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Ted...
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Good-bye, darling.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Kill them both.
Here?
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Did you talk to him?
Why did you do it?
Who said that?
Screw you.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Which one is that?  Raw what?
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
I'm going home.
She's going to divorce me.
We?  You've taken it?
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Could it be intelligent?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
That the atmosphere processor?
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
I don't know.
So.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
Well you're not reading it right!
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
They'll get us.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
It's game time.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Fuck you.
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Thanks.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
They're dead.
Did you ever have a baby?
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
I knew you'd come.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Extremely clever.
Is she a good fuck?
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Why what, sir?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Well, don't do that again!
What's the matter with you?
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Wolfi!
What does she want?
Yes, my love?
It is miraculous.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
Leave him alone!
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Yes?
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
What is it?
I have no idea.
Why are you here?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
How many pupils do you have?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Yes?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Leave that alone!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Did you like it, then?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
Did my work please you?
You flatter me.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
I think so.
You go fast!
I am so ashamed.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
No, but I'm the best.
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Do you hear me?
You cannot say that!
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
I poisoned his life.
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
What? Who the devil are you?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
What exactly did he call out?
What happened to them?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
And what else?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
What shall we do?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
I thought you were asleep.
That's not really a very proper question.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
Lovely.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Do me an enormous favor?
Don't you remember?
No what?
Why on earth do you say that?
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Who is this girl?
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
Some, everyone does.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Yes.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
David.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
That's a wolf's head.
What about it?
It's in front of us.
Thanks a lot.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Jack, are you really dead?
You don't have to say anything.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
What can we do to assist you?
Then you have some hot tea?
Hello, Tom.
How much?
Whose death?
Oh!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why not?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Why, Cyril, you're insane
What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Yes, sir.
Shall we let the people come in?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning, Helen.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, sir.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
What did you do with it?
Oh, ten dollars
In Cluett's office?
Oh, Matt . . .
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
How are you fixed?
I couldn't lose him.
I'm sorry, Cole.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
I think I recognize you.
How?
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
What is wrong with you?
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
It's not a bank.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
We'll make them pay for this.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Cannon or Gatling?
Both would be nice.
What the --
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
The safe. Now.
You're right, sir.
You're doing just fine.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You can shut up now.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Bob's upset.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Yeah, Jimmy?
That he was.
Jesse, is that your hand?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
Me neither.
Hmm.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
But I like the presidential suite.
Last February?
Thanks.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Well, not exactly.
You been with a girl ever?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
How can that be?
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Nice?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
J&B. Straight.
Yes.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
What exactly do you mean?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
What's that, a gram?
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Two at nine? Perfect.
After six.
Oh, something. . romantic?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Yes, Patrick?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean? What?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Where are you?
No. Flattering, but no.
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
She's my...cousin.
Who?
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
How old are you?
Nice. Very nice.
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
I've questioned him.
I'm hungry.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Is that a raincoat?
You are a fanatic.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
I know, I know.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
That'll be a test, won't it?
Right... What's that mean again?
Is it your software?
We tried!
Did you?
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
That's great! Thanks.
Gary, I --
Let's go.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
You do?
Cool!
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
But why would they --?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Please don't go.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
You may.
Thank you.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
When do I begin?
Yes?
Right away, Exposition.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
What's wrong with your hand?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Watch out, you're on my hair!
I haven't had fun like that since college.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
I am not.
Really, Austin!
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Yes.
Don't mind if I do.
Commander, I have to log it...
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
An evil vet?
An evil petting zoo?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
You didn't...
Well, it's kind of weird.
Seriously?
... bottle ...
Knight ...
Love...
How long have I been here?
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
May I help you, madam ...
You are female?
I have an appointment.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
We want to help...!
An unholy trinity ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Valentine, listen to me ...
Choices?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
And I suppose you're the knight.
For a man in my position --
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Do you always drive this fast?
No trouble.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
But you did suspect me.
You don't trust me?
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
No idea who. No idea why ...
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
Where are you going?
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
You don't believe him?
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
Global warming?
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Think she really killed those agents?
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
I don't want any trouble.
Great car.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
But a fabulous cook.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Huh? Wha...
About what?
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Yes.
Really?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
I'd love that.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Feel free.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
What the hell is that?
I think you'll enjoy this table.
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
Hey, you guys...
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
I don't know.
Oh these moments do try me...
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
-- Knock it off!
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Just come down, John. Just --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Thanks.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
This?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
...Not now, Brian.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Hey.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Then why did you quit?
Who's doing this?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Oh Jesus Christ...
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Then who wrote the report?
Did I say thanks?
Brian?
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Coffee sucked.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
The great communicator.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Putty? On both doors?
He works for me.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
I forgive you.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Oh, really?
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
We're ready when you are.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
I've never been given a fair shot.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
What do you want?
It's been a long time.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Do you know how you will use him?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Hello.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
For what?
Thanks.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
You sound like the media.
I don't believe it.
How's the food?
He said that?
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
You know how your Daddy is.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
You sing and dance?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...like macaroni and cheese...
The good stuff.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
What is the service, sir?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Have you not a man whom you value?
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Yes!
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Good night, papa.
Is he all right, papa?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Can I at least have a drink?
Hurricane kept you up, too?
What do we do?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
I just don't like it.
Some.
That'd be my reaction too --
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Back up.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
They?
I didn't kill him --
Why did he come back for you?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Something funny, Levi?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
You mean not enough to save you.
Tom, where are you going --
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
You knew Sergeant West?
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
You and the Colonel go back.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
You're kidding.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Maybe we shouldn't go.
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
Tell him to shut up --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Did you see that woman?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
Lucky girl.
Really.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
Stop.
Really?
Karl.
Really.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
What did he say?
I thought you weren't dying.
Why not religion, Dad?
Dad!
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it!
Hello.
You didn't become crazy.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
That's because most of it never happened.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
What happened?
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
Yes.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Ch...
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
I need to know who you are first please.
Oh.  We are Russian.
You're asking for my documents?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Binoculars.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Today is bath day.
Syevodnya
They go. John. They go.
What's wrong?
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
No I don't.
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Oh Jesus.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Get out
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
What?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
Yeah. No thanks.
Okay. Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Is the flight full?
Lazarus?
I need to uh...
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Hey.
Yeah.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
I deserve better than this.
Don't... don't say that to me...
Well I don't...
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
Want another?
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
What'chu sayin'?
What'chu sayin'?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
I skipped lunch.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Hey.
I feel better. Do you?
Got in a little accident.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
The hell are you talkin' about?
I think she got to you, pappy.
What's this?
Why?
-- I should tear your head off.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Did I say that?
No.
You did great, Ichiro.
How many men?
She ever pull down her shades?
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
She's such a long way home for you.
One guy do all the damage?
It's not your job.
He was my partner.
We're police officers.
Because I want you to tell me.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
You had my help, detective.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
Why tell me this?
Death.
I've done some questionable things.
Like what?
His company made us.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I think, therefore I am.
I didn't like her.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Do you have something against science?
Vodka!
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Who?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Book the good ones for where?
Yeah?
Yeah.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
Black?
How do you know I'm not?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
You want to go home?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Whatcha doin'?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Oh, now, that's a great one!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Where are we going?
I just had a mental picture of...
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
I can't, it's yours.
I think it's the eyes.
How long would you need me?
Very funny, smart ass.
I guess we'll need another locker.
This is for me.
I didn't know that.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Thank-Q!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
The guy with the underpants!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Adam?!
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Tempus fugit!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Why?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
And it's called...?
Who use to own it?
What's the capitol?
The recovery is very impressive.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
The hotel.
My father is a genius.
What?  What is it?!
How do you do, ma'am.
Right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
We have to go.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
All back East.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
It shuts off automatically.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
No.
You have tranquilizers?
Why?
Hi, honey!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Yes.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Some time.
I forgot some of my stuff.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Alright, I will.
I think...it...works.
What's it to you?!
Those sluts!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Oh, no!
And if we can't find him?
Have him committed.
We came back to the house!
What?!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Frank. Come in.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
What color is it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey nothing.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Do you know?
Frank? Can you stand up?
Nice guy. Who's he?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Yes.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes. Frank--
I sure don't hate you.
Yes.
You what?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Yes.
Yeah, it's me.
Frank gone?
Frank?
I don't want to go.
What are you lookin' at?
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Nothing. I'm fine.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
What did you see?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Okay, okay.
You were late.
You like mysteries that much?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Go ahead.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Fuck you.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Yes mother.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What? What is it?
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
What?! What are you doin'?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
I don't know they just always need it.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Aye.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
You... oh god, why?
Pee...Per...Man.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
The Greeks. The Italians.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
What?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Hello? You there?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Yes.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
What color hair does he have?
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
She's really kind of hot.
How was I ridiculing you?
It had an alarm.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
You think we're going to be chased?
Like he meant it.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Obviously. That's a given.
See, now we've got a plan.
Where was I?
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
She doesn't need to know.
I'm not. But there's --
Our money situation is not good.
Shut up!
You could give somebody a concussion.
He doesn't want to fight.
Get out of the way.
Eleven fifteen.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
As a person?
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
I'll see you there.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
You're living on a sailboat?
You mean a safecracker?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Me?
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Death.
No. Bob did.
Yeah.
Let them fight.
Bob, where you going?
Why not?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Let's not even talk about it.
How do you say nineteen?
What?  What?
Like silk?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
I told you they were there.
The weed.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
How long has he been in there?
You don't even know his name.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
What's his name?
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Right. It was extremely stupid.
Come on, Bob.
I couldn't hear anything.
He's having a heart attack or something.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
The elevator broke.
What's that?
Here we go.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
And what does that cover?
Join the party, fellas.
Well, I think --
Where did he go?
Who? Applejack?
Is that your chiquita?
I want to know about Treadstone.
Let's talk about Conklin.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Had to be done.
What do you have, Danny?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
You still should've moved.
Try again.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
But we were so careful.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
You drive.
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I know it's a dream.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Oh, shit...
We need to get in there.
Mr. Nevins?
What kind of problems?
So he fooled you.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
And why is that?
Yes. In that order.
He was a modest man.
What news of the north?
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
You mock us with a smile?
The little cow is insane --
When will his trial be?
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
You know it's a trap.
I don't want to be a martyr.
How many?
A common thief.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I've missed you.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Tonight then.
And I with you. But you must wake.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
How do you know this?
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I am trying.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Who would do such a thing?
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
What is it?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
We're gonna be late again.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Can't he come out for one day?
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Where are you now?
But I... I need those books.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
Why are you doing all this for me?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh? There's proof now?
Where are we going?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Smells like sex in here.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
I thought I was the bad guy!
Shut up, Tommy!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
How long have you been married?
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
No thanks, Carl.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Er, my check, please.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
I must find out what Berger knows.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Apparently he has the letters.
He suggested I ask you.
Ilsa, I --
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Be careful.
How do you do?
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
What of it?
I beg your pardon?
But we made a deal.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I believe you have a message for him?
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Even in Berlin.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Victor Laszlo.
Oh, but I just told you. --
He'll take one.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
I have the letters right here.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
Yeah?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
No. Not me, boss.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Yeah, boss?
What's that you're playing?
No, I don't.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
You've had today's water.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Oh?  You've tried?
Well, not really, I --
He is a cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
"We're" not over-reacting.
There isn't any us.
Get back?  From where?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
If I'd known you were alive --
What will you do?
I love you, Chuck.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
I am one lucky guy.
Really?
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
You what?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
To Wilson.
Take your time.
Thanks.  For everything.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
And that I can drive a truck!
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
I better go.
A movie *outside*?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Did you grow up around here?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Yes, for both.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
I'm happy I amuse you.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
You okay, Rose?
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
You're a superstitious fucker.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
So we go to the bar.
Who's that?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
I'm going home
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
You'll be there?
You can't cheat an honest man.
Come here. Feel this.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
What is this? You guys cops or something?
Don't worry about it.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Sounds respectable.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
He was looking out for you.
Tick-tock...
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Him.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Then who's the Banker?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
The Indian rope-trick.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
How about fifteen hundred?
I want a job, Giles.
Habib?
I get it.
And your lady?
You're my prisoner.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Why not?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
The door, Jack.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Don't let yourself down.
I've lived there.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
Which side do you like?
I didn't.
What kind of trouble?
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
You're serious.
And I thought you were only after my body.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Of course I recognised him!
You've been avoiding me.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
What are you, a cop?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I put them on together.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
The key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Oh, God...
Do you remember the detonation time?
Hello, bomb.
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Well of course I exist.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Mafhkin oble groop...
-- open circuit breakers --
-- Remark.
I need a diameter approximation.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Not now!
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Sorry.
Sir?
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Men... men... what happened, men?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Can I say something in my defense?
Why would I be pissed?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
No way.
What else can we do?
What makes you cry?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
First time I ever heard that.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Lemme get my coat.
Lauren's not my wife.
Girlfriend?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
I won't be staying.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
A girl.
I already don't like the sound of this.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
What's this?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
No.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
Not right now.
I actually know how this works.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Make the call.
You get it when I get her.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
A toy?
And why should she?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
What about this?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Cool.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
They're what?
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Two hundred bucks?
Not if I shoot first!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeah, you did!
Good MORNING!
Dr. Monnitoff?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Who is... we?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
I am so sorry.
Wanna walk me home?
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
That was a compliment.
Where are you going?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
We're moving through time.
So, we call them... IMGs.
What? How long was I asleep?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Who is the boss?
Can anyone else see him?
I know.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
What else makes you feel regret?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
If God exists?
God exists because you're horny.
Frank is going to kill.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
What's her name?
Her name is Gretchen.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
That's enough.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
How did this happen?
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
But now you can't go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Mrs. Leeman?
C'mere. I love you so much.
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
I just did.
Yeah...
I know.
Loretta, shut it.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
That's right.
That bitch from...
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
So help me, Gladys.
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Oh! What is it?
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
My dear President...  read it back...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
Anything else? 
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
Oh, Rufus!
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
I thought everything was working out fine.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Well, these things take time.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Yes, I think I can.
I feel much better. Thank you.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
You've never been?
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
y-y-yes--
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
...Yyes
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
...Yes potatoes... but...
The hospital?
Ohhh...
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You want a dressing bag, John?
Is it the one you wanted?
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
I said welcome.
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
What's the matter?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
Halfdan the Black.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
But you don't want to hear it.
No.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
Why should you care?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
We're missing all the fun...
You talking piffle, son?
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
That's better.
I've got you!
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Look, I bagged it last week.
Hy-Brasil?
What do we have to do?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Let me go, Sven.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
Made by YOU, Loki!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
So did your father...
I must KILL! Kill!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Dad!
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Yeah.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
May I help you?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Really?
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Huckleberry Hound?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Take care.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
What do you want to hear?
Thanks.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
Let me drive you home.
Let's talk about it later.
You're drunk.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
What do you mean?
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Joel!
This is our first "date" date.
I'm sure, I said.
I told her today I need to end it.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
When?
I don't know. What if it breaks?
What took you so long?
I guess so.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
I should maybe talk to you.
Naomi.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
I miss you.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
It's just... y'know... I mean...
We haven't checked.
It's stopped.
Hey.
Then why did you ask me?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Yeah?
You can if you want.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
What was that?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
About...
You're political, then?
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Thanks.
I was a successful model once.
Whooee!
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
A job for me?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
I don't know anything about it.
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Do you hear it? Right there.
What happened?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
What's the hold up?
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
What does it say?
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You... You can't do that!
You're lying...!
We've got some weather.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
How much oh-two do we have?
Carbon dioxide?
No. It was someone else.
Miller...
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
First time in a grav couch?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
You got any coffee?
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Yes.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Those yours too?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
He didn't.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
What about his first born?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Sweet.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Then what is it?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Which was?
And reverse the mutations --
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this?
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Easy, mon.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool too.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Well... it's true.
See you later.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Oh. Hi.
We've got to get an abortion?
All right... where did you see her?
No.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Really?
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Poor guy.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
Who's that?
All right.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
How's it going.
It was okay.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
What do you think?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Can I come in?
I couldn't make it in time.
The point sounds fine.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
We keep them.
I had a really nice time tonight.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Really?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Naw!
Naw! Not a major.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
...and we're chock full of that!
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Why?
Jesus creeping shit!
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
What tape?
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Like big lizards.
Me?
Some of what?
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
So do we, lady.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Could I have that, please?
What?
We can't risk letting them in.
We should go! We should go right now!
Where are you two going?
Where's that?
And the rest of 'em?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
What tunnel? Where?
We just smeared a skunk.
Just an observation.
Yep.
What's in the back?
What is this?
Will I go crazy or something?
But --
How much you got to see the show?
Huh?
I'll go with ya.
Move slow and move quiet.
HELP MEEE!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
DON'T!
Let's go!
You know you don't have to do this.
We all have to be strong, right?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Oh. I mean, good.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
In my eyes, officer.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
GET OUT!
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Showdown.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Thank you, Ralph.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Are you an actor?
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Okay then...
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
You think I'd miss it?
Enh.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Don't start, Farmer.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
What a man!
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
...Is that not true?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
Your big speech?
You got it.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
What's wrong?
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Where are you going?
You're not going anywhere!
Oh, just leave those things for now.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Oh! Are you really?
Stay calm, please.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Yeah?
You were with him at the end.
Yes.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
I don't know.
Friend?
She's beautiful.
She's not for you.
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
What does it say?
Have you seen Willie?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Henry Clerval.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Yes? And?
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Paracelsus?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Tomorrow is another day.
Oh, my God...
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
What the hell?
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
What hath God wrought?
How about our last jay?
Don't call him.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
It's just a dream.
Are you wet?
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Real McCoy.
Was? As in not anymore?
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
What did you call me?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
Did he...?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Mexico.
Yeah, we got a bible.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
No.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
How's it feel?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
Really?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
That's what you think?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
He needs our help!
Who's...  Lieuten --
None at this time, sir.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Across the board, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Entering my scan now...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Hardly the case, Senator.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
I can make this wall without --
The Navy Cross...
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
She's haze grey and underway...
So dump on me.
This has nothing to do with you.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Which is guy-speak for...
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Whose orders were those?
You got anybody, Wick?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
32 feet, six inches!
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
I think you're the liar.
O'Neil...
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
The first female President?
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
You okay?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
My life sucks.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Did you talk with Humphries?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Call me Charlie.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
They didn't make it.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
What are you suggesting?
We know.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Just don't.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Come on, old friend...
Nothing.
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
What the hell is going on?!!?
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Alex you can't -just leave.
A boy comes to the door.
Alex? Where are you going?
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
What's  your name, son?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
No, wait, are you-
That's It?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
A hologram...
Never mind, Fred....
Right.
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
How do you remember this stuff?
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
They're still behind us...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
Only answers to me.
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
There's nobody here. Jason...
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Theramin.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Excuse me?
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Because they're coming right at us.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
The army can survive without me.
I hope I never have to believe that.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
Well, George, who were you?
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
We've got powder but no ball!
I'm so inclined.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
Sir, I think no such thing.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
Yes, I believe so.
I'm not sure.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Makes you gag.
Oh, come now...
Unofficially, General Greene.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
I feel the same, sir.
My God, what?
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
That's right...
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
What the hell are we doing?
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Or, 'civilized'.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
I say!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
My daughter, I ask only...
Juba was a Numidian.
You're kidding me, right?
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Trade for what?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Not too bad.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
Where is my nephew?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
He's around someplace.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
What money?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
In just a second. Two...
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
I don't know.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
What?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
You live in Miami?
You're an investor, is that it?
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Leo spanked a waitress?
The shylock's the good guy.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
Maybe a few times I have.
Once.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
One of his best parts.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
Martin, look at me.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
It's not one of these?
You broke in?
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Harry -
Which two?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
North Island, please repeat? Over.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
That's what it says.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Where from?
Roger.
A what?
Did you?
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the hell happened!
Coffee.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Same. Any luck?
The ah... the radio's out.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Victims of what?
Murphy to Epps.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
We could call for help.
Ho-ly shit.
You don't remember?
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
We're still drifting.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
What about the gold?
No, no. You got leak.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Hmm.
Well, yes...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
It's not optional!
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
I just stopped in to say hi.
Why?
Nothing.
Oh, hi...
God, what a bunch of retards...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Since when is she an "actress"?
Why?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Hi, Al!
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Does Oomie really like this show?
Hey - why do you have this?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
SHUT UP!
Ew, look at this...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
JOSH!
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
How about this one?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
I totally, totally hate you.
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
He came into work.
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It's fine.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
You still interested in that?
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
That's not even --
...are you waiting for a bus?
That's five hundred dollars.
Well why do I care about that?
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Jesus...
Wow, this is so cool...
You can open your eyes now.
What? You're kidding me...
Boo!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Can you at least let me in?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Please Josh?
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Why would she be hiding from me?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Seymour?
You were contracted to work-
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
Then why do you stay?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
How lucky we are.
What a good week.
We need to talk.
...misfire... it jammed...
Have you ever failed?
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
I'll have to.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Why do the workers look unhappy?
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
Soon. 
How many cattle?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
What are you working on, Egon?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
I'll do it.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Who are you going to call?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
Can I have some of your water?
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
I'm Egon --
Who?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Did you find anything at Dana's?
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
I told you, I ...
Don't scream.
You're the best one in your row.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
Did you see it?  What was it?
The EPA?  What's he want?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Two wavy lines?
What on earth gave you that idea?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Where's the Keymaster?
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Set entry grid.
Looked at with your eyes.
What is it?
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
What?  What popped in there?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
What is that... wailing?
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Caesar?
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
I'm serious.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
The Senators admire you.
They fear me.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Tomorrow?
My troops don't make policy.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
I was summoned.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Who the hell are you?
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you always drive like this?
Where is the car?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Where we going?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
What is the matter?
Benjamin --
Yes.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
You do?
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Here he comes.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Because it isn't true.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
Yes.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
No.
Hello -- who is this?
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
What did you do to her?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Could I make one phone call first?
Could you bring it up?
I'd rather not.
Hello.
A single. Just for myself, please.
How are you, Benjamin?
Why not?
What do you think of me?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
I know that. But I'm --
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
The number.
Why don't you watch?
You what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Well what do you want to talk about?
Oh my God.
How about art.
Yes I do.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What novel did you read.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Why are you asking me all this?
What kind of car was it?
Oh my God.
Then let's hear them.
Benjamin?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Don't start acting hurt.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Where is Elaine?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Sure.
Why did you say that?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
You believe me, don't you?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
I guess -- about my future.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Now look -- please --
That's quite a statement.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Have you a minute now?
Well?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
He must be very nice.
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
Why?
And...?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
And?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Bless you...
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
No -- not at all.
That was my last.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
How's the beautiful lady?
The war.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
I don't know.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
This gentleman can have my room.
Send his bags up to my room.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Yes, of course, -- money!
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Oh yes, of course.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
You...
Moreover...
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Hello!
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
You've decided against the merger?
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
You're a deep one.
I can't dance tonight --
Let us cancel the engagement.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
It is time for the performance.
What -- what is it? Last night...
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Yes, I know them --
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Have I kept you waiting?
No. No word.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
What's bluff?
That.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Want a look?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
I know.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
What? Me?
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
I like those.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
Myra followed you, huh?
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
Just a few bucks.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
You're getting off the grift?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
I want to know everything about you.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
You were gone for a while.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
You watch that mouth.
No question, huh?
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
The cemetery...
That's it?
Yes.
A dead body?
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Nothing.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Now you're joking, right?
No.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Who?!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
What are you looking at?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Can't you hold it?
What's this?
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Who are you?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
God, what's wrong with him?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Danny?!  Danny!
Where's the baby?!
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
Where's the child?
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
Yes?
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
How all the magazines show tits today.
You know what gets me?
At least we found the diamonds.
I didn't tell you everything.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home.
I'm liable to find anything!
The educational process.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
You're an imbecile.
For what?
To make an ass of yourself.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
What's good about that?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Go on.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
A hundred dollars!
Dad--
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
How do you do?
What's the matter?
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
What then?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
It couldn't!
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I came for my clothes.
Things.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
I mean it!
Help your mother find the bullet.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
You've killed women?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
I've never heard of it.
It died for your sins.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
I see.
Can't do it.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Who's dead?
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
I don't want to live any more.
No.
Still lives with his mother.
I didn't know that.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
No.
Don't know.
That man is your father.
What does he say to do?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
My father!
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
He is my father.
I'm glad.
Is he all right?
What was it?
What's the matter now?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
That's the XKE.
I wish Paul luck.
It's suicide!
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Paul's only twelve years old.
It's good.  Let him go.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
No, just not the type.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Do you want to take a session?
No, I don't.
What do you mean?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Wait?
How many weeks?
Hello. You want some information?
I don't know no Tod.
What girls you got here?
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Are you sure it's all right?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Nah.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Three hundred?
Up front?
No.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
But what?
Why do you say that?
Where is he?
Mast?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
What do you mean?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What happened, pilgrim?
Is Marsha there?
Wes, do me a favor.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Well...
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Hold it, mister.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
You ever play Chicken?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
To his own daughter?
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
And what are you studying?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
No, no. I just took it.
Okay, lady. Out.
No.
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
Eh, no. Thank you.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
It's very interesting.
All right.
Harold?
Eh, fine.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
What do you think?
Because they are all the same.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
But I don't play anything.
The ice is melting.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Don't you advance on me.
Just like this.
How about some candy floss?
- end where I began.
I feel giddy.
"And this too shall pass away."
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
How do you do?
Does that worry you?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Eh?
Harold!
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
You knew?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
He... he loved me.
God, that's terrible.
He talked about Demons, huh?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
What is it?
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
The freak in the gas mask --
Reliquary --
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Who's the squirt?
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
I knew those men better than you did --
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Yup.
Helping you -- I just --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Are you sure about this?
You better have that looked at.
Red, I --
I like that...
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
Pardon?
Julia's my second wife.
We've got such sights to show you --
It's important.
No.
But you said --
Back from where?
You're hurting.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
You're still afraid.
She'll tell them everything...
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty? It's very late.
Like who?
You're still blaming me.
Why not?
How are you doing through there?
It's probably going to need stitches.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Maybe a brandy.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Please...
I suppose that's right.
What's wrong?
Where are you?
No Dad.
Well I want you to see the house.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
No you don't.
I won't be able to stand.
It's late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
She's so damn... English.
Steve. Thank God you came.
I beg your pardon?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
What the fuck is that?
Isn't it?
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
What's up?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Haven't seen it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
We're getting that anyway.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Who are you going to see?
Anna.
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Nice friend.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Hi.
And do you like it that way?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
Of course it is.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
We'll talk some other time.
Will you call me?
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
Me?
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
What do you want to do?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
Look, we can do other things.
What it was like.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
How?  How were we the same people?
Harder.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Hi.
WHAT?
Barry said its done.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
You called this morning?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
It's true!
Enough, Liz.
You share a place with T-Bone?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
I'm sure it isn't.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
But you must have --
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
No.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Jesus Christ.
You?
I'd rather hear yours.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No.
No one knows you're here?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're a fool.
You did kill those men.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
You are a very perceptive young woman.
What about that family in '31?
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
Get out.
The inheritance.
I'm just curious.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
Thanks.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
All fashionably without heads.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Aye.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
What?
It is as you are.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
This is madness!
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Why does he want to kill me?
Why?
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
I am not ready for this.
Something pretty.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Don't threaten me, Private.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Your father must be smart.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
I don't know.
Spare a chair?
He found us even there.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
You're wrong.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
We have some unfinished business.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
All I need is time.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
You're a kind man to be sure.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
Too hot?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Yes, wasn't it?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
No. My mother.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
How long is what?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
What's the matter?
Dead?
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Where'd you meet this man?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
You said it.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Now you're talking!
Exclusive? That's great.
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
She jumped out of the window.
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Hildy!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Is he coming back here?
What did you do with her?
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Well -- what is it?
Hildy!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
How about Bruce's?
It'll be Heaven!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Anything you want, Boss.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
They're always after me for interviews.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Goodbye, Yonson.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Phone for you, Hildy.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Don't forget about production for use.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Don't talk too loud.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
What's from the Governor?
You mean here in the city?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
No, she didn't.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I did see them. I did.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Why not?
How's your war, Mac?
Except the servicemen.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
And what's that?
We don't know anything about it
It looks....foreign.
That's it.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
Out.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Is it peace in out time?
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
Yikes.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Tiny's home.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
What about the tree?
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Great story Goober, how much?
The Duke?
I don't drive cross country.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Just grin and bear it.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
How's about you give me those same directions.
That kid is one horny retard.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Tickets for what?
So what?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
I resign.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
How long has it been?
What'd we here, Georgie?
Recover any bodies?
That's the understatement of the year.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Tell him, Harold.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hello, my little boy.
Say my name.
Like father, like son.
Oui. Perfect!
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Of course not.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Is everything fine?
Oui.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Well, I think...
Well?
Anyway. Come already to the point.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
You were wonderful!
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
It's okay, Puff.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
That's what I'm counting on.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
My brother is discreet.
My brother says he likes you, too.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Yeah. My brother told me.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
It looks wonderful.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
He looks perfectly fine.
What?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Such as what womanly things?
Bravo to you, Puff!
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Oook. Oook.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Interesting.
Unn.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Yep.
Give me a bottle of beer.
I'm ready.
Do we need words?
You know what's good for him?
For whom and for what?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Cut.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
I told you. I got drunk.
Thanks for the drink.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
For me.
Hello, Eddie.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
I got time, Bert.
Fifty per cent?
Aaaahhhh!
Maybe. You want to play?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Yeah, that's right.
It's quiet.
Fast and loose, man.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
You don't need a drink.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Go to hell.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
Findley.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Couple of bucks.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
You better not miss, friend.
You quittin', friend?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
What time does the bus leave?
Do you always ask so many questions?
So why go to college?
I drink.
Hey!
No.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What time is it?
At school. It's Thursday.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
A loser?
Is that what makes a winner?
Does it bother you? What he said?
Leave now.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Game's over, Eddie.
I came to play pool, Fats.
You name it.
Do you remember where it is?
Why don't you start with me?
We don't know that --
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Do we have to?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Why, Dad?
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
I had an awful dream.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
Where's your car?
I left it at work.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
Yes.
Do you know how to follow a map?
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I don't see anything.
Your father asked you a question.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
It's really nice of you to help us.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
You're being paranoid.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
I take it you've heard.
You saved a lot of lives.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
What's the bad news?
What happened?
Spunky?
This I can see.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
This is ridiculous.
You know me...
You scared the hell out of me.
I shouldn't have left her.
Damn it!
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Many worlds...
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
I usually don't.
It would make me very happy.
The Ark of the Covenant.
At least I let you tag along.
This one. I think he's in here.
But what are you doing here?
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Through the library?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Will you take it easy!
I came here to save you.
What am I looking for?
My lucky charm.
I ought to tell you something.
And the chair.
Dad!
What?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad, are we hit?!
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
My name is Kazim.
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Interested in local curios?
Charming.
Who?
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
What's that?
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
You don't look very good.
Can you move your arm?
PET IT??!!
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
I want to go home...
No... they won't kill me.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
The last Sankara Stone.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
My name is AL.
You're not gonna believe this...
It wasn't him.
Why don't we go home?
Where are we now?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
I know...it sounds insane.
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Anyone there?
Why? AL  You know too much.
I am. You are.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
Door's locked.
Go out, take your first left.
Take a left and your next right.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Like the guys that attacked us.
What about money?
Use my credit cards.
...and a license to kill...
You'll be me.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
The beach?
Why not?
What was?
Don't just stand there, say something.
Where is she staying?
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Which one is she?
I don't know what's going on.
What is it?
What Happened?
I don't know!
And on my time.
No. What will you do.
On what?
Sapporo..
Where are you going?
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
He was with Gruner!
I don't trust her.
Well...?
This may hurt.
Gimme a minute.
Rene?
Now, you're too suspicious.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
I'm against it.
...Foreign service.
When you do...
Remember what?
Oh.
You'll feel better
Joe.
Al?
The fresh tuna?..
Is someone else here?
Blake?
And you?
I am sort of scattered.
You are.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
Why?
What's he done?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Hiroshima.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Riuji?
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
Excuse me?
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Just one. The back up.
Mom...what are you doing here?
It will.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hi, honey.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
I'll take some.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
Sure. Where?
Push it.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
You're exaggerating!
I'm afraid you are.
Debbie...
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Okay. 
Come again?
Hello?
You're sure you want to do this?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Why? Who said?
Use the bathroom.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
I'm alone on this...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
It would be better if he called us.
Alright?
We're there.
Lowell.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Oh, please, Mike...
...but that's as far as I go...
Should I just take the documents now?
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
What?!
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
Just give me an example...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
There is -- there is no family.
Where you staying now?
Right.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
"I would bet on it."
Chapter and verse.
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
You're in check.
Got any symptoms?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
It's your move, Miles.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
You like kids.
I begged you to have a baby!
It sounded like a bell.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
But you don't agree?
He'll regret this.
Oh, for the love of...
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Getting married.
She never particularly cared for me.
No.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
What is it Miles?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
No.
Oh Miles!
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
You have to leave the house immediately!
I fell in love Miles.
Marylin!
Marylin?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I was devastated. Of course.
He never even asked. He just assumed --
He was right, wasn't he?
Wow.
You're not...
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Oh brother. Here we go.
...arty farty!
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Did Marylin end up with money?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
Wait... He wants to give her...?
And she has...?
What do you think?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if
Mr. Warne?
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
That's an evasion.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
South America.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
What've you got against King Westley?
Please don't shout.
I knocked several times.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Peter Warne! 
Why? Do you know him? 
Are you going to see him?
If you really mean it, I will.
What would you like to have me do?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
What do they say?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What happened?
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Here, boy!
Of course I do. What do you mean
Now, just a minuteyou can't
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage. 
Outside!
Hurry up and get dressed.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Nope. No complaints.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
What's the matter?
But what!
Sure.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
What are you thinking about?
No. But I've got a penknife. 
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
You might give me a little credit.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Me?
sixseveneightnine
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
But can't you wait until morning
I've been thinking about you.
Yeah!
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
You're drunk.
When you sober upcome in and see me.
ain't got a hat
I ain't got a hat.
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Whyno
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
No.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Keep saying what?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Go on, Willie.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
But why?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
What was so appealing about Houston?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
And then Sunday?
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
I'm scared.
No, you don't!
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
I'm not sure I understand.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
David Ferrie.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
They killed him, honey.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Ever ask him?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Germany.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
That sounds fun.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What?
I need a favor.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
She wants to make a deal.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Take your time.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ordell pick up his bond?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I didn't?
Who is this?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
Why?
It's different with men.
And Annette's it for you?
I go back to work tomorrow.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
What if he checks it?
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
How'd you find out?
We're partners.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Spain.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
What if I plead guilty?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
I know what it looks like.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
What for?
She didn't say.
Yes. All those things are true.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
What did you do after that?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Oh, hi.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
It looks good on you.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I don't know. One of your friends.
No, I give it to someone else first.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Four years?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Where were you?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
About five years ago.
You live with him.
Thanks, Baby.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
As low as two.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Sure.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
What does that mean?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
You shot her twice?
Where did you shoot her?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Jesus Christ.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
They don't have your winning personality.
That's Winston. He works here.
Haven't a clue.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
It still sounds high.
Somebody already did.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
I thought you might be asleep.
That's all?
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
She's been there since Thursday night.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.
It's the next street.
Who is it?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
He's around.
What are you then?
Let me out of here!
No, thanks.
Are you all right?
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
What do you want from me?
You have an unusual hand.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
There's nothing to expose.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
You need ... a doctor.
Why do you say that?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
I'm not cold.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
The room!
They're weird names.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
The best.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Why you left.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
He's coming right over.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
It's just me.
Let go!
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Don't!
Who was that?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
What's going on?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Sit down!
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
One drop?
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
I don't know what to say.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
Dream on!
We're doing everything we can.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Speaking.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
The army?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
You got lucky.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Can we blow it with just two?
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
The hull's imploding!
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Sergeant!
Kicker, anything?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Did you like it?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
You lost the charge?
They'll make it.
And what's with the headgear?
Jesus!
Who are you apologizing to?
Leave him behind!
What?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
You got it.
This is Matt Hooper...
What do you mean 'We...?'
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Do you see the kids?
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Where is he?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
He lost it on the way up.
Got a pen on you?
Who are you?
Rogue?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
What the hell?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
I didn't know her.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Well... is everything all right?
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Thanks for the message.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
So, what do you think we should do?
Really? What are they like?
We could get back together too.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Hey man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Oh, God...
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
I'm a junior.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
Blood and guts.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
You don't have to do that.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Consider it your musical education.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
What are you?
No?
God, you're so young.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Is the baby okay?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
You mean like couples?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
I am a suicide risk.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Unfortunately, yes.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
A Pilates machine?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
What?
You dropped this.
Do what?
...Anything else?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Yeah but, what is it?
...I don't know.
What's wrong with her?
Where you from Walter?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
This the book your writing?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
You two been busy in here.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
I still think we should have met them first.
What's that?
Carrie... stop it.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
What is it?
His Parole Officer.
She can fuck?
Did you tell her that you loved her?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
That.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Shut up.
How much you gonna take?
Nah.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Sup then? Sup?
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Come on.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Do you care about me?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Did you bleed?
Yeah?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
It's like...
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yeah?
Four-thirty in the morning?
Hello?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
To come?
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
What do you want?
Local?
You still having a problem with this?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
Hello, Peter.
Why not?
You're not going to tell me that.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
What makes you think I was there?
Very good.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Very good.  How did you know?
What's this?
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
What is it?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Feeling better?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Any sign of rape?
Same as the others?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
Did you see his face?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
A building?
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Did you send the car?
You have something you want to say?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
What are you looking for?
They couldn't break the riddle.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
Another kind of game?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I thought you said the line was busy?
Nothing.
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Why not?
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
Are you going to come tonight?
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I don't have to go through with it either.
<u>What</u>?
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
I know it.
Take the western passage.
I won't leave you here.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
They know when they're going to die?
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
No! You cannot know that!
Am I not worth returning to?
What business?
Fame.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
You will follow me.
Not sleepy, either?
You've eaten nothing.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
What is that awful looking place?
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Look at its insides.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
Yes. We lost five.
The new King.
Yes.
It is no trickery.
Why must you know?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Well, I don't need them...
OK, I'm fine.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
...I'm going to kiss you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
How many girlfriends did you have?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Yes.
Yeah, what?
Mathilda, listen!
...Yes?
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Is he still alive?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Why am I such an authority?
I don't accept that.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
What would you like us to do?
Pardon?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
What?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
No.
Walk with me?
I want children.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Maurice?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
You tell stories?
Making the grand total?
Where?
When are you leaving?
She knew you loved her.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
What do you think I should get?
Orange soda?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Are you serious.
Thank you. What time is it?
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
What was that all about?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
I wanted to see you...
You know I love you... yeah?
What did they look like?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Where are you staying?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
What alibi?
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Were you with another man?
What?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
That's not what's important.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
What's going on?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Where you got in the shower.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Is everything okay?
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
I think so...
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
I'm a bitch.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Picking out my wedding dress!
Did she do that to you, too?
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Neat.
She's completely untrustworthy.
Okay, how would it work?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
I completely agree.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
East coast people are different.
Thanks for the backup.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Where?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Is it a Kappa?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Birdies... pretty...
Damn you!
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I don't expect you'd understand.
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Or looked so beautiful...
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
You come stealee tleasoo?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Nice piece of work.
My God!  Look!
Something the matter?
What make ye of that, Jack?
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Dolt!
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
Sunlight?
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Exceeding fair.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
And sweet?
Please...
Heading north still?
Is he a friend, then?
Lost?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
I don't know.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I might not stay, anyway.
Not really.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
You'd hate him for the trick.
I don't wanna go.
Why is that?
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
Will he talk to me?
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Pardon me?
How's your wife?
Right...she married...what was he?
I'm not.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
What can I do for you, George?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Thank you.
Why would you be there?
I'm not going!
I'll hate you forever.
I don't know.
I'm not doing it!
I'm leaving.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You're too fucking late.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I wish you had told me then.
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
Sun glasses?
After everything.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Thanks for telling me.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
She's a little sad, is all.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Why call me?
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
I love those doors.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
I can't leave the house?
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I used to live here.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Do you remember?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Going on?
What did I say?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
That was the truth.
You bit my finger.
No.  Mostly me.
Don't move!
Been thinking?
What the fuck?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I was talking about our marriage.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
No, nigger.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
I got it... boss.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Engagement ring!
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I've never seen you in here before.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
Oooh...
I said you're soft.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
So?
No, man. I want you to have it.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
That's the way it is.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
It's too late for plans.
Yeah? You and what army?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What do you think about that?
Mama?
They gave me life, mama.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
And he's dead serious.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Urr... uggg... errr...
How did you see me?
Where is he? He's late.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Everything's fine, pop.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Bus?
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Good idea... kill me.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
What were you thinking coming here?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
What other food?
I am.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Why?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
That was a great shot you made.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Why aren't you in Nursery?
You felt sad. What's your name?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Why show me?
What're you going to do?
Maybe you'll think of something...
I'd rather be with you.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
How will they know we're coming?
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
You know, Jessica.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
No.
All this. All of it.
Come with us.
Hello, Sandman.
Where are they?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
We're leaving.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
They're comin' with us.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
Hi.
Okay...
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
What deal?
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Yes.
Alice...
What night is that?
Hey.
What's up?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Sheila?
The wife killer?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Repeat that, Bill.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
That's not Fred Madison?
When he went to work, right.
Do you remember?
What is this, Rogoff?
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
From the club. You didn't answer.
Yeah?
You're up early.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
What's that? Another tape?
We've got to call the police.
So?
What was that?!!!
What?
Let's go home.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
I can see that.
Suit yourself, champ.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Why haven't you called me?
Last time I saw you.
You still care about me?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I don't know.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Yes, sir.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
I beg your pardon.
Look here
He might have lost his way.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Will you stop squawking!
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Leaving?
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Then it's done.
As far away as I ever want to be.
How can we get in touch with them?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Are you taking me?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
Mine?
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
I don't know.
That's what you said.
George, come back!
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
What about the others?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
Good.
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
I'm thirty.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I wonder.
Why?
Struggling, why?
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Hesitated, sir.
You shot an eight year old girl.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
It'll make sense later?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
All the time, sir.
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
We'll take it from here.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
It's a bug.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
She didn't even know you. .
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
what's this?
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
After I got the shit beat out of me!
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
When?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Noon exactly.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Wally!
Is it now?
That's comforting.
I can't even stand up --
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
You the only sentry?
Try again.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I go running down there.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
To them.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
You set me up...
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Rufus.  She's a precog.
So?
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Wanna hear something funny?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Oh, Sean --
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Heal who?
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
Not if I stay away from him.
What?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
It's insanity around here.
I thought you were retiring?
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Sir, the press conference is starting.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
I don't understand --
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
Precog Deja Vu...
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Right here.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
I don't know, why?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
What about your meeting?
You mean after he lost your son.
But John was with him at the pool?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
What are you talking about?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
No thank you.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Is he cute?
He's great, right. Is he great?
Ricky's not wearing one.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Yeah, sure.
Get away from her.
He making the drop?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Yeah?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Why?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
They were out of line --
No.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
I can wait around if you want.
Ricky's taken care of.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
What are you saying?
How am I being shitty?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Ask if he said anything to her.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
We don't need guns.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
What are you doing?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Nothing.
They asked who it was.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
I don't know.
Yeah. What vibe?
Like I said, I don't know.
You too?
You got that right.
Where?
Put that shit out...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Let's do it.
Let's check out the penguins.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Bobby and Ricky.
You want your surprise?
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Ugh...
It means you got a gun?
Stop.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Ow, shit...
What do you want?
How's it going?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
What about my keys?
I get it.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
Who's gonna outfit us?
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
I am.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Man's rep travels.
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Then the devil is white.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
The body is a holy repository.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
I see your point.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Why do you ask?
How old are you, Betty?
Are you?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
What do you want me to do?
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
Just what is your question?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
What?
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Murder.
You had the number.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
I'm the man.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
He told you that?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[The boss did or his brother.]
[What money?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
What are you doing here?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Why not?
So you were unhappy?
No.
How do you think he got out?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Why do you ask?
You feel sorry for the husband?
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I'm sorry.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Be a swimmer.
The world of our children. How dare they?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Last night. Do you know something?
For a year?
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
Good news. You're going back to school.
I like him, Mom.
Our child's safety is at stake.
Hmm?
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
That's what friends do.
What was she to Creasy then?
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
I'll call her up.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
We just talked.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Well, he died. You know who else died?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
You come up here often?
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
Marty...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
You say something?
I'm stag.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy...
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Yes, O'Reilly?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
That's right.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
He can't take much more time on the table.
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
The chest-cutter.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
Ravenous. What about you?
Wait a second...
Give us this day our daily...
Gimme three.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
What for?
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
Black capsule.
Look.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
I don't feel anything.
I don't get it.
What do we do?
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
What's the matter?
How did you get called that?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
It was really nice of you to take me along.
You really say the cutest things.
Why can't you look at him?
There's only one worth noticing.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Damn.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
About me?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
The Websters.
The Websters!
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
What?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
In what man!
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Plus a bonus.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Well, maybe you're right.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
I ain't seen him for a week.
Yeah, a little.
Baseball?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business!
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
No, I didn't write it, but
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Yeah.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
No -- you can't do that.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Could I please have a little water?
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Really?
What?!
Hi, Roper.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
You don't have to come here.
What's the point of this?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You'd never been out of New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
You think you can learn, McCall?
Get good at it.
Why?
You know why I like the track?
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
The jockey!
Is it always like this?
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Is the hostage injured?
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
There is?
Stay here, don't move.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Where's the damn wire?!
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
And a car.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Why --
This is how you pick up women --
The guests are here.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
How long?
What about the customers with reservations?
New York.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
What?
There was no need to kill her.
Then where is she?
An interface attendant.
Insurance?
You said we were on the same programming team.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Realize?
There?
Just like that?
Don't know what you're talking about.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Access established.
He's on us!!
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
Two thirty three a.m.
... Not bad.
There goes the neighborhood.
And how do we release the power?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Anybody see them?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Are you frightened?
Life knocked me back.
And now you have everything.
No. Not everything.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
The deal's too good, Frankie
I'm already late.
Luciano.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
You fellas got names?
Like Don Maranzano.
How soon can we pull this off?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
What about the share.
And the Jews?
They do what I tell 'em.
You disrespect our tradition.
Masseria's been after me too.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Jesus.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Anything!
You're fuckin' crazy.
What?
What's the maximum safe dose?
Uhh - martini?
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Tell me what?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Land of Death. How do I get there?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Who?
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
What's the matter?
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Stu...LOOK!
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
You want to come inside?
So, what do you think?
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
What pictures?
Mom, I need to talk to you.
Really?
So, you come here all by yourself?
... Oh ...
I see.  How much?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Thanks very much, sonny--
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
"There's more light here," he says--
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Shut up, Diz.
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
I apologize.
Again? Good idea.
Good idea. When?
Is the wind tired out there?
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Me! Jim--how--?
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
I yield.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Will he *yield*?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
No. What had you better--?
Right.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
What's that?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
No.
Have I?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
It *is* not!
I've got more. You better tell me.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Do you want to dictate them?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
But--I've done everything I--
Oh--Saunders--
How are the pigeons?
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
And how's your bill, Senator?
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Chick--
Go away, Nosey.
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yes--
Well--me, too!
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
You won't stand for it?
Jim, you don't have to--
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
His first 'whiff'!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Good morning.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Pixilated.
Are you married?
Thank you very much.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Yes!
Yes!
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Tell me more about yourself.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Uh-huh.
There's Times Square.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
What's the matter, hon?
Uh-huh.
How'd you get the picture?
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Yes, but you said
How's it going? Okay?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Come on, John. What happened?
Nuisance value?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Wants to know who the heir is.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Yes. That is to say
Why should you?
Nah.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Huh?
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Proceed.
I write poetry.
Who are they?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
No, sir.
Oh, I do too, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
You must have been concerned.
Dr. Mumford.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Why's that?
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
No, not really.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
I see.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
What brought this on?
I've had my moments.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
Yes, your honor.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
My patient had to leave early.
How long you been in this town?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
He told you.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What do you mean?
Why don't you tell me?
What can you tell me about this?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
What would you do?
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
Either one.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
I'm glad.
You feel violated?
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Will you think about it?
That's not quite what I said --
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
Do you think that's what he wants?
He agreed?
Nah... scotch.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
At least you pulled yourself out...
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Lily.
When?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
That was a terrible thing.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
What just happened?
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
You lie.
I just decked your brother
You know your history.
For what?
That "thing" gets me excited.
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Why would I do that?
No... Why?... Should I?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Who's here!?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you did.
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
And what's that?
We didn't think this through very well.
Much less go outside.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
But you're a superhero.
What did he mean?
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
That boy's got talent.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Are you with me... or against me?
I saw him walk you home.
Hi.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
And what if you get killed?
Bye. 
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
It is not dead. It is hiding.
But there's still only six of us.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
Nah.
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Let's go.
So where's the art?
The Obliterators!
Firepower costs money.
You guys going to a costume party?
Wow.
Really?
Ow.
Definitely.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
Proceed.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
About 5,000 troops.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
But who made this treaty?
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sire?
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Ah-hh, no.
Hello there, Picart.
When you eat him, may I have some?
The first reports came in at about ten.
What is that?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
No, sir.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Oh...?
Thank you.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
Will you use the troops?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
She must have been in love with you.
Yes -- what is it?
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
I believe you sent for me.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What the hell is the matter with you?
My God, what do you think?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Do you like music?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Does she deserve anything better?
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
That is a matter of opinion.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Come in.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Well, let me in.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Stretch it out.
You know what he mean, dude.
It's about to work, just come on.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
You straight?
I can't taste nothing.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Damn, you got a stalker.
You better stop running from that girl.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
You go first.
No.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
Why did he go in the house?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
What you say?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
What urgent message?
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
My back.
What's the matter?
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
What you doing to my nephew?
Mr. Nasty time?
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
What's he doing here?
What happened here?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Huh?
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Yes, yes, I understand.
Yes, I'm listening.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Come back.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
On TV.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
No...kisses to you.
You remember me?
What?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Yeah, all right, listen...
Irene is going to help.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
It's under control.
Yeah.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Leavin', boy?
AAA-MENN!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Is he hit pretty bad?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What?
My, that fudge smells yummy!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
What!
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
It's all here.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Don't you hurt her!
Huh?
Nothin'!
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I don't know nothin'!
O no! Your turn!
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Harry!
You were listening outside the parlor window.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Much better.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Hello Nancy.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Right home after.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What's with the bars?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
I never touched her.
Do you think I did it?
No more fights.
When did you have a nightmare?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Good evening, Anna.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
Yes.
Just for the honeymoon.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Yes, Comrade?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Have you?
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
Get out of here!
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Comrade.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
That's two weeks from Thursday...
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
I think so too.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Gladly.
What?
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
That's a strange angle.
Yes, it is.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
Ni-notchka.
That is correct.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Will you smile?
I don't think so.
A funny story?
Are we going to build our little house?
Not white, darling.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
...and we won't clench our fist...
Our salute will be a kiss.
No music.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Yes, Swana, you did.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
What is this, Swana?
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Madame, if you...
You leave me no choice.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
What do you want?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Where do you eat?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
Where the hell is he?
No, we have nothing to hide.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Why me?
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
I figured that out.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
And?
He wants money.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
We can't touch Hoover --
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Sorry ...
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
What's Liddy got?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Well, why not?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
Yes, Mother ...
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
It was illegal, what he did.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
Jesus Christ!
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
So I'm supposed to be ...
No, sir ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Were you planning to tell me?
I don't want them to love me.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
They're all your enemies?
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
No ID in her room?
None of that explains your man though.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Hard to believe.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
That's possible.
But you don't believe it.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Probably must be.
...Now that's aggravating.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Yes sir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
I thought it was a car afire.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Don't hurt no one.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Well I didn't see it.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Goin' out.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Yessir?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
I don't know.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
With anything?
Yessir.
I could come back then.
Well... I need to close now --
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
You married into it.
Yes.
Everything.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Sir?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
When did you last see him.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
That's me.
What else then?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Are you jackin' with me?
Yes sir. Two tours.
...I meant your food.
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You must be joking.
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
You never gave us a chance...
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
David, please --
So, call me when you --
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
I got you, Del...
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
What's his real name?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
What are those for?
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
No, almost never.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
What 'look'?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
What the hell was that, another statement?
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Wesley...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
What do you mean?
What'd you get her?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Better.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
David Ravell.
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Her show?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Mr. Campbell?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Waitaminute -
Hang on there -
It ain't the law!
...Pete?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Okay, Everett.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
Where's your ring, honey?
That's right, honey.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
When did this happen?
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Pity you don't have the character.
It's important, sir!
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
What did you call me, boy?
No, sir.
Where are you from, boy?
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Something tells me you've been here before.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
That was you guys, huh?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
I'd like to come with you.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
You're welcome.
God.
You should see the look on your face.
Remember that.
I can't just...
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Keep your voice down.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Asshole.
Pure idiot.
She's never coming out.
And we're never getting in.
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Oh, I've seen these...
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
That room!
Shaky?
Chills?
Small space?
I am.  I'm here.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
I don't know. Look around man.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
You want me to put a man on it?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
So what's the deal?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Yeah.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Huh?
Where is he?.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
You don't look alright.
Yeah.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Well?
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
You look well, Charlotte.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
Balderdash!
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
One of yours?
Where is he now?
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Not held, just slowed down.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Don't worry.
But father, they might come this way.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Was it Pascow?
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
God, that's fine.
What were you listening to?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Not yet...how much further is it?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
It's Church.
I don't know.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
But--
What say, Louis?
Why? For God's sake, why?
What did we do, Jud?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Yes.
What?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
I think it's rather extraordinary.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Thank you, Louis.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
Aye, aye, sir!
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Commodore, you can't do that!
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
What?
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
It doesn't!
You are despicable.
Me!
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Exactly.
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
We had time to get to know each other.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Just do it quickly.
No.
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Jack!
Yes, I have.
... No.
Commodore --
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
What are you going to do to him?
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
What did he want?
What's it smell like?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Yeah.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Nothing really worthwhile.
You're insane.
... just like the mouse.
We don't?
Got it.
Argon's private lab.
Susie... I...
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
We were different people then.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
That's impossible.
And you have him?
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
Don't mind Mother.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Where did you get those letters?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
Your place?
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Ah-ah-ah!
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
You're the Tribune man?
Is that so?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Right - for the first time this year.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Is that so?
I'm not quitting!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
You what?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
There you are!
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
How far have you gotten?
Been where?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Who was that?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Traps shut!
I suppose you know why I came?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
I beg your pardon?
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
I won't.
Wait ...
Oh, George ...
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
But where would we go?
... Lover's Lane.
Sure is pretty.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
Want some bridge mix?
Oh, no thanks ...
No. What?
What happened?
Do you know that it's illegal?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
The basketball team?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
Green.
What happened?
I still don't see why we're doing this.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
So what's the point?
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
Me too. Sounds swell.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
What do we do?
You're gonna forget about me.
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Why would I do that?
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
Where are you going ...
BUD.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
EXCUSE ME?
OW!
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Bud?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Forget about that!
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
... What's that?
Oh GOD ...
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
Well, I can't talk though --
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
I'm trying to be your friend.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Sure.
No.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Hi....what....what's up....?
I know but I....how much is it?
Really? Please?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend --
Why did you tell me you did, then?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
Not very well.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It's fine. It was fun, though.
I saw a picture of you.
Yeah.
You were talking about the promotion --
You see?
....No....
Oh that's great.
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Hello?
Lena?
Yes.
Do you wanna have sex?
I'm fine are you ok?
For what?
Ok, bye, bye.
I cut myself.
I know.
Why?
Yes it is.
Can I ask how much is this?
What do you mean?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
Who is this?
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Yes I'm fine.
You're goin' on a trip?
You should go on a trip.
WHICH?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
What are you doing?
Yes I am.
Nothing.
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late though.
I know.
What did you say?
It's ok. That's alright.
It's not bad, it's ok.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
We should be going --
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
Are you ready?
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
That's enough.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
What on earth would that require?
It's no secret that you loved her.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
Do you favor its publication?
Shut down?
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
And my own.
As for the author... shoot him.
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
I pray you: be succinct.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What thought is that?
Of course.
Leave at once --
I wonder sometimes.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
I did my best but, well, you know me
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Oh, why is that?
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Yes?
Sir, I-
Keep filming.
Huh?
What are movies about?
Manolete?!
Who the hell's Manolete?
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Why her?
What?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
Hedy Lamarr?
Is that from one of the Gospels?
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
That's for me to decide.
You're lying to me.
Yes
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
I really think you're
No, we're jake. But listen-
I know what you want but it can't be done!
They wanna talk to you.
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
This looks done.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
How do you know? You know her that good?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
What?
Does that mean...
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I can't find my ball.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Take off my pants.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
What's the matter with you?
I went out.
I called. You weren't there.
You did?
Then what?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Sure, what else is new?
Open the door, Vickie.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
It don't look right.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
I think they missed their chance with her.
She never left the apartment --
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
For getting rid of that cast.
Wrong day?
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Jeff --
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Hello.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
How did you know!
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Would four of them -- ?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Hello.
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Something big going on somewhere?
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
You mean leave the magazine?
Don't you ever have any problems?
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Homework. It's more interesting.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Maybe she died.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
What's the apartment house number?
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
The same.
Wasn't that close?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
How?
What?
Where can we meet?
Sure.  It's fine.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
You thought I was Mom?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
I don't think so--
I was talking to Jim.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
No!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Is he there?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
I'll wait for him.
No.  I don't think so--
You shouldn't monkey with him.
Jim.  What's yours?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
I know.  That's why I came back.
I just don't want trouble.
They're looking for you!--
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
What?
When was that?
I don't want you for my father!
I'm here.
I've got a gun.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
You promised to give it back.
Wash up and go home.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
They never do.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
See, I'm new.
Won't mother be proud.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Why?
I'm getting that way, too.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
What?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Plato, where's your father now?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
No.
She's being called for.
How did you know that?
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Yeah.
No, c'mon --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
You sold him out.
Nick, please, it's me --
You're in on this.
Gabriel!
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
What?
No --
You... you don't know me --
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
You knew the place --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Why not.
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
No way.
No, you're not.
You gotta be kidding me.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Cancer-sucker.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Fuckin' freezing.
Five years. Since it opened.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
What, working security?
Jesus, Rudy --
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
...for Christmas...
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
I'm sorry.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Mr. Pink.
He don't believe in it.
Freddy Newendyke.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
What happened?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
A few cops.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
He ain't dead.
I don't know anybody.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
He's learning his letters.
I suppose it is.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Will she be dark or fair?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
In a fight?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Where'd they go?
Can I have my gun back?
Go on, hit me.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
I don't care what she asked you.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Don't act so -- crazy.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
We got to get movin'.
I said let's go.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
What are you doin' --
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
And that's tough, isn't it?
You were supposed to be reading words.
She was only teasin'.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
No, I won't let you do it.
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Ouch!!
Help!
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Where's Shorty?
Yeah.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
What about you, Buddy?
He's here.
Better try a little higher.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Okay, I get the point.
But he'll kill her!
Oh, right.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Stop! --
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
This can't be happening?
I'm sorry.
Am I cool now?
Uh, uh.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
The image there.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
What the hell?!
What is it, Dwight?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
And sexy.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
0h, shit!
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
No comment!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Chip, your ride is here.
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Shhhh..
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
State your name, please.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
That's like your car, Beverly,
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Mrs... Sutphin?
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
You forgot something...
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Sure I do.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
You could go and open the door.
No.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
How much have you got?
Redi's all right.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Weren't you afraid?
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   
I'm going to find your sister.
But I'm not joking.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Well?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
You'll be all right?
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
What's wrong, Mary?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Uhhuh.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
Tell me what?
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Cloven hoof?
Would they hurt her?
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I'm afraid not.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Yes?
Why
Because I have something very important to do.
What?
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Sister older or younger?
Would you mind?
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Why is that?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
So you don't believe in therapy?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Donna?
All of these are interviews?
Can we look at one?
Yes.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
This is just... so...
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Why didn't you tell me?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Why not?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
I guess not.
So you do fantasize?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
On tape?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Subtlety?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Who? Elizabeth?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Come on!!
I want to touch you.
Something wrong?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I'm not either!!
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Bastard...
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Radon leakage?
What visitor?
No, he left last week.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Do you want to leave therapy?
What?
Well, I wonder why.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
Why not?
What kinds of questions?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Cynthia!
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
She still is.
Nope.
You just want to ask me questions?
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
I would.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Cynthia, I don't know.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Could be risky.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
You told Ann about this?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Student?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
So is my wife, asshole!!
Yes?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Who was she?
That you, Rog?
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
You got it!
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
We're the experts.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
McKinley?...McKinley?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Could I do that later?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Poor Brad.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Do you really think so?
BRAD!
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
That's an extremely negative response.
WHAT A JOKE...
We love you, Baby.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Gary.
Glass or bottle?
They're from both of us.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Oh yeah.
Good. How're you?
Highliner, please.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Yeah, Conundrum.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
What?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
It does. Feels right.
Yeah. Tight.
Sure I know Maya.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Shut up.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Aye-aye, captain.
Later.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Can you give me some room here?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Could be anything.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Is it the money thing?
Do you like them?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I don't have to.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
What?
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Look at this!
Maya, how are you?
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Are you all right?
What about me?
Yeah? Like what?
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Okay.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
About a year.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
It was a surprise, Mom.
This one?
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
Morgan, be careful.
Do you think it's a possibility?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
They're distracting us?
They're broadcasting...
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
All I did was kiss a girl.
That's why they got you in jail?
Forget it.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
More than enough.
Paden sends his best.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Offend anybody lately?
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Where's Turley?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Women?
Doesn't look quite fair.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
Yeah?
I'll see you around.
Who?
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
What's that?
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
We didn't get that far.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
The jury saw it differently.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
I heard that too.
So we understand each other?
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
That's the good stuff.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I'm glad we talked.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Where is she?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
-- I can explain.
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
... Simone.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Where are you?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
Why?
What I do to Simone?
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
You never were together, Hal.
Clyde.
Hal, what are you doing?
You want me to call Security?
-- Flesh is weak.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Me too.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
What?!
Do I know you?
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
It's a hotel.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Let's take it down a notch.
The only real truth is in the work.
Wow. They called you their son.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Congratulations.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Know what?
What'd you write?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
...No.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Can I ask you then?
I don't know.
I don't know, Cole.
I have to.
No.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Someone got hurt.
They did?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Like what?
What--
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Chicken blood on the crops.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Nope.
Slut.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Hi.
...Hi.
Aha. The Lovers.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Throw me one.
Who? Us?!
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
What's wrong?
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Where's Mac?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
What?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
No. What?
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
What are you doing?!
Yeah.
Who's the lucky fella?
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
When one sees you they all see you.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Why're you driving so fast?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
An existentialist.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Can I ask you something?
Hey...
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Let's hit it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I'm proud of you.
Ummm?
One to five?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
What can I say?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Or in the slammer.
See.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Go.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Loud and clear.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Now what?
Go head on, breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Pick it up, Breaker.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Shut up, Fred.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
That's the point, Dickey.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
Anything on the Swede?
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
He's giving them up?
No.
Mmm-hmm.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Yeah, we've been through that.
Without peer?
That's probably him now...
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...So you made another deal?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
Yeah... Sid?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
A million flat.
Yeah... Sid?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
-- never in a million girl --
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
For real?
A Fed? Like FBI?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You're not Gibarian...
What happened to Gibarian?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Listen --
No.  There's no behavior modification.
You murdered her!
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Not necessarily.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Get out --
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
Jesus...
Why?
Stop it.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
What do you remember?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
You still don't believe in God?
I think so.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
Sartorius.
But we fought.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
But that's what happened before.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Is that really what you want?
I wish you wouldn't.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
What does it want?
It's terrific Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
What did he say?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
He said he'd kill me.
Claire?
Hmm...
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
You asked.
Open the door, will you?
Yeah.
They called here after you left...
I don't know you...
Not exactly.
You don't want to know.
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
How long you going away for?
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
Who's Joey Venza?
Not Koontz.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Are you in charge here?
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Under the table.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Nice threads Dad.
She's what?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Don't be pitiful.
Can't focus...
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
You're making my life difficult.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
My my.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
What the hell is that?
How is he?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
I will finish what I've begun
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
You're sure you're all right.
He'll try to finish his experiment.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
How much more do we have to take from him?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
I'll live.
You are being rude again.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Interesting.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
You want Betty Grable!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
No?
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
You'll fix me up!
You did?
Grable, not Gable!
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
You want to go?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
We did it.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You did!
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
What did you say?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Commander.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
I get it. I get it.
We're within range, sir.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Left behind?
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Captain, are you all right?
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
It looks like we're too late.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Locate.
David!... What went wrong?
David, I don't understand...
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Short range scan.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
How many more?
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
My God...
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
See! That shimmering area.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
... A cloaking device?
Close... There --
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
You should take the Vulcan, too.
I -- saw no future --
But -- why?
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Success, my lord.
My Lord... what are your orders?
How is that...?
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Shore leave, Admiral.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
So are we, it looks like.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Yours... is... the superior...
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Just barely, sir.
On screen.
... No response, sir.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Not enough against their shields.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
<u>WHAT</u>?
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Where must you go?
You do this -- for friendship?
I would accept that as an axiom.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
It'll come back to him.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Hi... Busy?
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
You're saying... It is a compliment.
What's your degree in, dentistry?
What's causing that!?
Damage report!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
You sure you won't change your mind?
Go ahead.
Do you trust me?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Thanks. Cheers.
Wanna try it from the top?
I'm all ears.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Here... In the park?
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
Yes.
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Aye, sir. Descending.
I have no control, sir!
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
The whales...?!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...
Right on. You fly?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
You have warp capability?
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
... an offlander?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
I understand.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Chase me!
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
No one's ever asked me that before.
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Captain, Geordi...?
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
It is not over.
I do not take orders from you.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
May I talk to you alone?
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Fail-safe?
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
Full impulse.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Would you like something to eat?
Worf to Picard...
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Captain...
Sir?
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
What...?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
Montana.  Energize.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
You think they're still up there?
How long has he been unconscious?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
Do you know what this is, Data?
No. I will not betray my friends.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Dispersive armor is holding.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
They're bypassing Engineering...
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
Even Data?
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
What the Hell's going on?
No!
Specifically of...?
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Possibly.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Kronos, sir?
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
I hope you're happy.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
Where?
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
How did you - ?
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
You having hearing problems, mister?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
NO WAY!
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
Do you know where you are?
No.
Beverly, come in.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Data!
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
How can you be sure?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Why is it moving?
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
Counselor.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Thank you, sir...
It's working.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Looking up at the stars.
Why am I here?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I won't defend my life to you.
Not so long.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
My God...
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
The bond is broken.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.

I don't see anything.
What did I tell you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Credit card.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Do you have children?
Where did you stop last?
Where's that?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
It's in a green Mustang?
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Please...
Ah... no...
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
Which way?
Pancakes.
No gas.
Go.
Who are you?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Space?
Who?
My... husband.
I am husband?
No.
In your pocket, please...
Money.
It was yellow.
When do you have to be here?
Yes. Day... night.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Is that a baby?
The driver will...
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
What happened?
You thought we were a different planet?!
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
What are you doing?
You can have one.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
But...
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
The yellow one.
What do I do now?
Slow down, slow down.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Bullshit!
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Can you see under the faceplate?
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Hello...
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Hey, fuck you, man.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Cut it out, Tran.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
You have to go.  I mean it.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
What do you mean?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Where's Faith?
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Your sex life?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Fumitsu.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
That would be no.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
What is it?
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Tell me.
Why?
I'm not going.
I guess.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
You never told me.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Besides that.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Anybody talk to the press?
You tell me.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Look...
You're a... you're sick.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
I've been looking for you.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
We have another one.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
"Gone live?"
You got a point there.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
He thinks he looks young.
Don't be too harsh.
Does Koessler ask about me?
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
And you're working with him?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Tom, you okay?
What happened?
Kulok.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
I want to help you.
[You tell me.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
So you're the new meat?
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
You have to put things in perspective.
I don't know about that.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Are you sure? Maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Nikki.
How was it hard?
It does.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
The poor thing. Six years?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Well, who represents you back east?
Me too.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Hello?
Hi. Sorry about that.
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
It's a gig.
It's definitely a step back for me.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
I do. Good for you, man.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Him?
You want to talk about it?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
She was cute.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
You live in such a fantasy world...
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Mike?
I don't know...
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Double down.
Always, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Yea, how much?
Let's go.
What an asshole.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
I don't think so.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
How?
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
You looked right at her, baby.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
How long do I wait to call?
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Now?
...double diamond...
...you're money...
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
No.  You ask for too much.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Eat it, it's on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
How bad will it be?
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Good for ten men...
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
For bravery.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Who are those girls?
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Will you give this to him.
How will they come at you?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I love you.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
How's Mom?
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Do you recognize my voice?
Is that good?
You'd say if you mind?
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
I met him in New York.
Sure. I love Venice.
I know. I write like a child.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Ripley's plans.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Ha.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Really? To Italy?
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Do you think you can steer this thing?
I guess.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
Far cry from New York.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Frances?
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Are you okay?
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Where's Dickie?
He hates being confronted.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
I found Dickie's rings.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I told you. He gave them to me.
It's all true.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
What's your secret?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Emily.  Just kidding.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Will we see you later?
Ten thirty?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Well that would be even better gossip.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Peter, I... I...
Of course. What happened to your face?
I really don't want to see anybody.
How much for everything.
You want to canvass?
Yes?
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Huh?
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Huh?
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
You sure he's not Italian?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
What did you do?
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
One-Ball McCall?
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Where.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
That's a nice name.
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Where?
Pittsburgh.
God, you are square.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You don't have to.
Why should it be grounded?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Why, thank you Travis.
Nice talking to you, Travis.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say, officer.
I'm here to see Iris.
Get it.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Real down.
Maybe.  Not really.
Thank you.
I'll go.
Mason.  Mason?
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
I see you got the telegram.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
That always used to work.
... including me.  Right?  
I do?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Were we going to get married?
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes... yes, I do.
Start with what you knew then.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
When did I leave?
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
... what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Zackly.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
What's wrong?
I... I don't believe this.
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Not at all.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Please, sit.
I thought you...
Yes.  Very.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
I suspected as much.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.
Cathy!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
I wonder if you could help me.
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The two kids?
I need her exact name, you see.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
A what?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Lovebirds, I see.
Yes, very.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
That's a chance we have to take.
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Then he saw.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Did you close the door?
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Yes.
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
What?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Lovebirds.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
Aren't these lovebirds?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
What are you? A policeman?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Yes.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
What?
Oh, yes.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
What did it say?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Why?
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Hear!
Hear, hear!
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Inland.
When will they stop?
Mitch...
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
You said three o'clock.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
For what purpose?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Of course.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
What's that you say?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Are you a doctor, too?
A doctor?
Don't call me that confounded name.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
But what makes a thought start?
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
A pleasure to torment me?
You and I should work together.
Nearly a year.
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Crony indeed!
You're not going to Gray.
Where are they? Last chance.
The strip joint?
Keep that thing away from me.
I don't know you, man.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
What did they give you?
The scar.
The scar. Which of you has it?
Are you ok?
Erin. It's not your fault.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
I know.
Fucking crow.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Honey. I just can't.
Are you ok?
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
I think I dropped an earring.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
I leave that in your hands.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Did all these people die in wars?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
You must have come a long way.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
Everyone seems so-- 
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
May I see you for a minute?
What happened?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
That's right.
What's going' on?
Hey, take it easy.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
I thought we were poor.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Well, I...
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Star.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
You've got to put this on.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
This room is mine.
Nowhere.
Michael?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Have you come across Fuchs?
What?
You catch anything he was saying?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Childs!  That a fuse?
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
What?
We should have jumped his ass.
Neither will we.
I guess you're okay.
In this weather?
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Put that down!
Don't let up, Childs!
How long's it been?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
Get back!!
Then we go after him.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
MacReady...?
I had an accident.
And everyone looks like us?
What happened?
How did you know?!
Sir... have you a name?
When was his mother taken?
It's what they want you to see.
Yes.
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I'll never forget this.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
A man can change his history.
I just love mechanical things.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
I know it's not a diamond but --
Alex, what is it?
Alex... people are staring.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
I've been working.
I'm sorry, David.
I know that --
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
Oh, that explains everything.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Do you have it?!
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
New Yorkers.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Where do they take them?!
How did you get hurt?
Kalen...
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
You ok?
What about Starks?
Should we be...
In where?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
Sure.
Jackie, go play in the snow.
But I like it I guess.
You're just gonna walk?
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I know.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
I could try to...make it stop.
I never knew my father. Did you?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
You still don't believe me, do you?
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
Well, how'd you get here?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
What.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Hey.
That's certainly possible.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Well, I guess I'd better...
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Can't it go to any office?
Will you at least see how it fits?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Whose place is this again?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
She thinks he's a pig.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Louise?  Where are we?
Yeah.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We can live in a hacienda.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Nah.
Well why don't you look her up?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
No You mean...?
Shoot.
Check.
Hm?
Huh.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Who?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
'That right?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Stalker, huh?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
You own a home there?
That sounds like fun.
Deco.
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
So...
All set.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Uh-huh.
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
So she hasn't changed?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Four.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh... Sully.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Hm?
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
It means you're too hard on guys.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
What's a mook?
Bundt cake?
Magda!
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Can I pour you one?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Oh, are you on the team?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Ted, are you okay?
Oh... are you... ?
What's that?
Sure.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Trying to be.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
I wasn't trying --
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
The other thing is...
Jesus...
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
An invasion...
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
Hello?
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
This is a restricted area.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Couldn't sleep.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
She's that subtle?
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Ray --
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What the hell do you want me to do?!
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
X22. Read.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Come back?
How the hell do you know?
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
I'll bet!
How did you know this was my car?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
Two miles.
It never came up.
You let me make a fool of myself.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
I'm different.
Let's make it at eight.
It's just as I thought.
You're totally insane.
You want to go ballistic?
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Danger?
...they say you're alright.
That's what you get flight pay for.
You don't have to do this.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
It does.
What truth?
Take something off.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
I live here, remember?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Ohhh Mother!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Just relax.
Let me do the talking.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
Hear about Ice?
ON THE NOSE?
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
Helping him in.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Then why are you here?
How do you feel?
Or....
He was by the book, all the way.
What to the rebels want?
What happened to them?
What happened to number five?
Shut up and drive!
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
What do you want?
I'm listening.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
You open it.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
What are you, my father?
Let me buy you a drink.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Where is he?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Lori...
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
What's in the two week package?
I'm not interested in that.
What's he talking about?
Forget I said wife.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
I don't need Kuato for that.
Ready as we'll ever be.
How much you think?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
You're gonna get us hung up.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Well, sure.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Oh, Jesus!!
You want the rifle or the Smith?
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
You go north, I'll go south.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Somebody paying you to do this?
We playing cards tonight?
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
Well, what's wrong with it?
He was your snitch.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
I can describe it.
We had a description of the suspect.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
Of course.
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
...For ten years, now.
You're doing a murder case?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
Got any booze in the house?
My mother find you?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
It was self-defense.
Oh come on, Cecil.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
I see: He'd walk out next month.
I don't think I know that name.
It's okay. It was always like that.
Shouldn't one of us...?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
And its purpose?
Soldado.
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
OK, Gordon.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And neither will I.
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
What do you mean?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
A blue rose.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Where are the Cookies?
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
You got it.
You missed somethin', Ed.
Laura, do you love me?
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Everything, but everything.
When he finds out.
You want to see...
You'd think so.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Fine.
School?
Who was that?
Did you get this from your lover?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
You're right. There's no one here.
Mr. Abraham...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...he wants to testify...?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
I wouldn't do it.
Just now...
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Well, many reasons, actually...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
Do you know who her doctors were?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
You live in the neighborhood?
Kathy Price...
Yes...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
Listen to me, fella...
Yes. It was, actually.
I've got to work.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
And it's over...?
Mr. Alito, please.
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Nothing happened.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I didn't do it, Mister.
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...I understand...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Yeah.
Are you out of your mind...?
...he's a good man...
...I have to stand up for her...
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
I can't talk now.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
...four years ago...
What are you doing in New York...?
She did?
I just saw her.
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
You look kinda lost yourself.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Is that... machine...?
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
That needle ain't pointing north!
Right.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
And I...I've got other things happening.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Just be careful, okay?
Guess so.
Chase, you'd better come home.
I'll be there in three hours.
Doctor...
DO you mind...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
What?
This is going to give you nightmares.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
You okay, champ?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
You didn't jump in.
What are you talking about?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
That was Nancy, not me!
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Now?
Coffee'd be nice.
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
What?
What are they doing?
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Yes, Sir.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Yes sir.
Make us proud.
Yeah.
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
Feels different doesn't it?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
We all have problems.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
What the hell is going on?
My parents don't do it anymore.
Well, spit it out.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Stow away?
Twice.
I should be eating with the crew.
Spying?!
It has nothing to do with him.
You're officer of the watch, George.
What's that?
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
What?  Come on...
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
Yes.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Easy for you to say.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Artie? That you, Artie?
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
What's that?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
Club Zanzibar.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
And?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
In a fire, as I recall.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
You mean like pedal pushers?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Come look at this.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Oh shit...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
How'd you know my daddy?
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
They have, sugar.
What's that?
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
Anything I can do for you?
I mean tomorrow.
That was in Vietnam.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Oh God! What does that mean?
I knew you'd want it again...
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Just tell me what you want.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Santos... I can't...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
So?
You really are one dumb asshole.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Not Curtis.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
You stay there.
His parents.
Which is?
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
He was never able to reproduce them.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
You must be mistaken.
You did.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
She told you about...
Her dog, yes.
No. There's no one here.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Sounds like a good one.
I'll miss my bus.
Can I ask you something about her?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Blocked.
How did I get here last night?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
How's that?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I never heard of it.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
What?
I didn't mean it that way.
But, last night...
No thanks.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I got the message you called.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
Yes.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Not have it.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
You got me.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
And what did you say?
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
This is important.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
I was thinking of you.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Cherry.
It wasn't like that.
What party?
No thanks.
I'm just talking, man.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
How does it sound?
What's up?
You walked home.
No.
Yes.
No thank you.
Are you sure?
How do you know?
That's right.
No fucking way.
I'm still thinking about it.
Honest? No.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
I'm not that crazy.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
What?
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.
And what are you doing?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
Are you okay?
There's something wrong with this picture.
What about them?
They could eat you.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
It's been a while since...
The morning?
What for?
The worst?
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
They seduce you?
What odds?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
Which brother did this?
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
You're scared.
Just think about it.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
You got it?!  You got it?
Your rig?
I'm switching off now.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
What about O-2?
Bud, something really important is happening here.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
He's jammed the mechanism.
Well, that's that.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
That's Perry.
Is that it?  Is this right?
'Fish'?
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Cab One, radiation readings?
How many are there?
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
When do you have to go back?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
No, Sandro... Please...
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Aren't you going to change?
I'm too sleepy.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
You say that just to flatter me.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
What is it?
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
No, not like this one.
Anything new develop?
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
They didn't seem too good.
Your mother?
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Because I'm getting fat.
Because...
Why?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
That's not what he meant.
Oh my dear child.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
I'm not hungry.
Why?
I don't know.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
For what?
That wasn't me.
Who?
Who?
Often?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
And then what?
In the middle of all the pain?
I... I don't understand.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
I've stopped menstruating
Where do you think babies come from?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
I don't know.
You'll laugh.
Do you believe she really saw them?
I could never be a mother.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
She's dead isn't she?
She can't hurt you any more.
Yes.
I'm afraid.
Agnes, you're stupid.
You're a mistake.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
And then what happened?
No.
Go away, I don't want you here.
Yes.
Are you frightened?
I hate him...
Yes.
What?
Eve, she strangled a baby!
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Larry...
I don't know.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
???
No, no, no...
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
It's your favourite...
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
Yes.
How did she hide it during the day?
Yes, but I...
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
I am not with the Inquisition.
I believe Agnes is different.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
Not simple, no.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
Then help her.
There's another choice.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
When was that?
You lied to me
Yes.
Listening to angels?
Nothing...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Would it stop you if I did?
You're what?
For the Church?
For Agnes.
How  ?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
The baby?
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
They are?
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
I'm a deserter, too.
Sure.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Ever seen one of these before?
I see you go to the night court.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
I don't snore.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
But I won't.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
It is, y'know.
Did you look in here?
He hasn't.
Oh, there you are!
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Are you supposed to be here?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
How'd you guess?
What's that mean?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
You can learn from books.
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
Lip reading.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Anything to spare?
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
Hiding.
That little old man.
He's got you worried, then?
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
You needn't bother.
Oh yes.
But...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Do you remember the pyramid?
I got it.  Oh boy.
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Activate lifter quads.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Don't you remember?
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
It grows on you.
Dead!
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
It's over, Hunter.
What do you mean?
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
How far?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
<u>What is it</u>?
That sounds a little fanciful...
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
Yeah?
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
It's out of focus.
Found what?
But?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
This ship is full of cat hair.
Here, Chaz.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Would somebody fill me in?
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
Engaged.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
We won't need it then.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Now what?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
Let's hear it.
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
It's a rhino.
Shit.  When?
Where're they headed?
How much air-time have I got?
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Whoa, wait a minute...
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Wait.  Lost it.
Is it still moving?
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
And before that?
Seltzer?
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
Think I spoke too soon...
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
What can I do?
Where'd you leave them?
What time's sundown?
'Bout five minutes.
How do you know my name?
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
It needn't be.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Aren't you?
Addison...
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
I didn't mean just the Theater.
What have you got to do with it?
I can't believe my ears...
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't think I'm going.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Margo.
We have that in common.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Just slipped your mind.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
Bill!
Where?
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
I'll try.
And cut that out right now.
Sing it?
Many happy returns of the day...
Need any help?
I had no idea you were even here.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
For instance - you!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
What's all over?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Well, I am.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
What would you like? Texas?
A married lady.
Why?
Why what?
You hear all kinds of things.
What did you expect - live sables?
Oh, brother.
Behind in your dues? How much?
She works hard.
Night an' day.
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Who are you?
That's all.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Hollywood.
I think she would cheer.
I won't forget.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
- an understudy's performance.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
The curtains. I made them myself.
I've got it.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Hello, Miss Channing.
They're your fans, your audience-
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
Coming?
Lloyd, what happened...?
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
Eve.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
- well? What happened?
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
To you, too?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
That's beside the point.
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Play it again.
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Anything to help you out, Max.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
All you got to do is name it.
Well...
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I promise.
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
What's that?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
I hate both parties.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
Goddamnit--
--shit--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I haven't said anything--
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Five hundred; six maybe.
Give me your checkbook then.
FBI too?
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
One minute but then--
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Who by?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
What happens when the baby comes?
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
I don't know titles.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
James McCord.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
Haldeman.  Right?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Sure.
What did you just say?
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
This is your plan, Finch?
Of course, Finch.  What?
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
What?!
Why are you doing this?
You talked to Stifler?
Uh...my dad's the manager.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
What about the game?!
Yeah right.
You got it, stud.
Of course.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Gotta go.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
You're not...busy?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
She's a mermaid, dude.
Who cares?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
What's up, fellas?
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh, Kev.
Like how?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Me too.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Here, babe.
Merde! Just missed!
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
God. How can you eat like that?
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Don't you want to change?
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Are you crazy!?
No wonder he let her go.
What does it say?
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Claude...?
Yeah?
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
What do you mean, maniacs?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Why would he pick this one?
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Enough. Cut him loose.
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Merde.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Are you running away?
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Is everyone all right?
No! I look ridiculous!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
By pulling my hair?!
Come on up!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Oh! I'm sorry...
Who are you, child?
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
You'd lose your security deposit?
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'll show you!
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
You don't want my autograph.
What?
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
It's an important issue.
Yeah? Allison what?
Well, why not?
Lyndon Johnson?
Tsch.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Duane?
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
Those are the two categories...
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
You see, like you and I...
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Do I love you?
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
I have a tiny apartment.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Let's just do it, all right?
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Following is different. I was spying.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
David? You call your teacher David?
Yeah?
G-go on, I'm interested.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
I'm following you and David, if you-
What's- It's me, open up.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Very big spider.
Yeah?
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Okay, let me have this.
Oh, I had the radio on.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Here's a real present.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Alvy.
What'd I do?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
My head is throbbing.
Oswald and ghosts.
You catch Dylan?
Tsch, a few.
I can think of another word.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
I mean that as a compliment.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
You all right?
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
M'hm.
They're persecuted enough!
All right-so we can afford it.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
No, no, no, not at all.
...of possibly working together.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
Absolutely.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
I'm in mourning.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Why didn't you bring him?
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Harry called.
Excuse me?
Cal, my wife Judy.
Give him a minute, Clair.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Yes.
Scout's honor.
Accept a compliment.
What?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Not properly watered.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
Okay.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Sally did all this herself?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Very well put.
What?
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Are you okay?
Lemon.
Yes.
And he doesn't smoke?
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
God willing.
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Thank you.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Panes is here!
You see, that's worse.
I wasn't finished.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Yes.  Fine.
I never like to talk about my work.
What did I do?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
Ah.
Nevermind.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
And Cal's this massive adult?
Not nice.  Not kind.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You're right!
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Well I guess that makes us even.
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Yes?
Come on, Z.
Why do they have you tied up here?
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
May I cut in?
...I should?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
I can't think of any.
So this is your mother's apartment?
What did I tell you?
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
I hope everything goes all right.
You mean tonight?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
How is your cold?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Oh.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
I forgive you.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
Your phone.
Who?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
I don't want it.
A cemetery?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
I'm sure that's the explanation.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
There's a call for you --
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Are you supposed to?
You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
You usually eat alone?
I guess so.
That's very wise.
Yes, sir.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
Sir?
Where are you going, Baxter?
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Naturally.
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
Mr. Sheldrake?
You can't come in.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Me?
What's her name?
It's regulations.
Aren't you?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Who?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Yeah, we better.
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
I told you -- with my mother.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
Get out --
No.
Tracks ?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
A long time.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Arch light.
Chef.
A sauciere --
Whatdoya think it thinks.
What'd he say?
They're not Cong.
Who knows? Right.
Anybody see some smoke ?
Would he remember you ?
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Terminate ?
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
How did they know?
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Captain?
What's your name, sailor ?
Thank you, sir.
You smell that.  You smell that?
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
When did you hear?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
I met him.
Fucking savages.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Do you know me?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
Gimme water.
I think think a lie stinks.
Fuck no.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
What's that?
Yeah... thanks.
Nah.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
What's this tiger shit?
That's me.
So Kurtz is alive.
Who are you?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Well , who's in command here?
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
215  CONTINUED:
She's dead.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I'll tell you everything later.
That's right.  You're not.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
How many do you see?
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
Don't bet on it.
Shut up!
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
If Corbett's men find out --
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Don't be silly. How bad?
I know. He's just the best.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
His name?
How old are you?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
How do you know about my mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
What's this?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
No, sir...
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Thanks, Melvin.
Hey -- you let him...
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
I'll take you... why not?
I had to see you...
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
How's Verdell doing?
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
It smells like shit in here?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Oh, my gosh.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Did you like it that much?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Uh, Fontella's
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
What?
Who is the mark?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Ten million --
Because he is trying to retire me.
Where you wanted to be?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Because you are a women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
My first take?
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Did it ever bother you?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
About?
Oh.  What do you think about?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
But he won't shoot you right then?
I don't believe that.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
Why?
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Did you --
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Honestly?
I'm not normal.
Four minutes.
I wasn't watching television.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
You mean quit?
American currency.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Like you?
How to make a buck!
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
You guys having a go a me or what?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
What's that? Free!
An alternative literary venue!
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
No....The Asylum!
I'd love to get in there.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Let's split.
Afternoon!
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, the boyfriend.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
What?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
It's...42 56 76 .
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Doug?
Turned Czech huh?
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
So, we won't be going to London?
No, it's not true, you're lying.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Will they free me?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Is it dry?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Who you saving the dishes for?
Better than you.
Where did you steal the car?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Why did you break into that particular building?
And the students?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
What for?
Come on Holly!
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
She's coming over here...
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Now it's okay?
Don't call him a dipshit.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
I'm very sorry --
-- Your act only works with an audience.
What's with the friggin numbers?
I'll take a chance.
I know. Don't say anything.
Because I try to be nice to people?
Looking for intelligent life?
In ten words or less?
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
He okay?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
You don't know what you want --
Your turn.
We can measure wind.
Loved?
Come on.
When did you build this?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
From citizen high to citizen low.
Jamie --
Why didn't you tell me?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
I've talked to your father.
I'll talk to your father.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Up to?
Dad --
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
Your parents are divorced?
You have materials for the side bearings?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
What do you want, Biff?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Hi, Marty.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
How are you?
Oh yeah.
Your line, George!
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
A gold mine?
Marty, that would alter history.
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
Perfect...
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
What theater was I at?
Pretty, isn't it?
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Catch!
Yeah, I guess.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Okay.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
Yeah.
You ever held another job before?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
No, you're not either.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
Jack.
No.
What for?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
How's he doing?
No.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Hi.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Wanta sue me?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Then what?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
What crate?
Dead.  Damnit!
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
This is so embarrassing...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
You keep an eye on it.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
It's too dangerous.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Hello.
I beg your pardon?
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
A souse!
What do you do far a living?
To see pap.
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Go ahead, son.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
It's okay, it's okay.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Yeah, but Charlie 
You'll be back?
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
All of which he's now missin'.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
How are you, Nick?
Who?
Catherine Tramell.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Did you leave the club with him?
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
No.
You know all about me.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
You can make a mistake.
What if I call you Nicky?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
Do you believe me?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
You have the right to an attorney.
It teaches you to lie.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Thanks.
I hope I helped you out.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
On what basis?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
New York.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
They're just words.
Out?
It's Andy again.
Hey  Willie Mays.
You got a date already?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
What's wrong with me?
That is amazing. What year is it?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
That's great.
Come on.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
OK! Goodbye!
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I need this?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I will relay the message.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
What're you really after?
Didn't I say that?
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
"We"?  You and...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Nor I, on the second.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
It does to me.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Son!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Pheromones?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfred's happy here.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
No sign of the snowman.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Where is my wife?
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
Our work?
Scholarly research?
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
He ran away?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
How are you feeling, young man?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
...Afraid.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Why's that?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
Just ones this beautiful.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
That's usually my line.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
I'm not-
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Excuse me.
I need to be part of this.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
How'd you find us?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Go ahead. You can say it.
How high up would you say that is?
Where's the boy?
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
How much do you weigh?
... How long have I been out?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
What did you see?
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I don't sing very well.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Finding out where she is.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
What are you, scared of heights?
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Where does one man get all this junk?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Alexander... I know you.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Liar.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Ahm.....
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Butt-dumpling...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Does that say Xanax?
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
That's better. Yes?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Oh no.
Wave at the lion.
Two hours.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Oh, honey, we may need that.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
Little black party dresses?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
3:30 I guess.
Aren't you dead?
This is <u>my</u> town.
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
All right.  Who are you?
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
About what?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Yes.
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
I cannot believe this.
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
No, thank you.
... Good night, Chauncey.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Can you see well?
... Are you sure you like it?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
I understand.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Yes, Ben - he is.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Oh, I see.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Yes. I would like to do that.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Hello, Ronald.
... Sir?
Some pictures...?
Let's have a look, do you mind?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Yes.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
No, I do not have any of those.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
... In the garden?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
You heard?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Good night.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
Malkovich.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
We have to make it an early night.
Hi.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You've always loved the animals.
You were him last night, weren't you?
Yes.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
I need a shower.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
The monkey.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Schwartz.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youre implying.
Yessir.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
You're a fag or a liar.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
What's he been in?
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
Can I be anyone I want?
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
But of course.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
She's not available.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Is there dancing?
Do you mind?
Darling!
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You don't sit with me!!
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Well, good luck with the job.
What you want?
Ya think?
In case of what?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
She likes this dress...
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
What run him off? Tell me that!
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
For what?
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
No, You looking good.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Come and get it.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
What do you mean, Dude?
Sheesh.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Heh-heh--
Color?
What's your drink, Dude?
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Oh yeah?
Excuse me?
I was talking about my rug.
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
That's really thoughtful but I--
No it's fine, really, uh--
And please don't call her my mother.
Jeffrey.
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Huh?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll--
FUCK.
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Huh?
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
It's a heart attack.
Dude.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Are you employed, sir?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
You come all the way down here to roust--
Whatta we do about the Mex?
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Two years.
You're hurt.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
How do you feel?
You came back for me.
Getting your attention, Paco.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Whistler!
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
But I just got here --
There is no cure.
Graffiti --
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Is he sick?
I've been better --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
What?
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
--or incredibly fucking naive.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Try, please, Anna--
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Yes.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
--the witch kills children--
Cheery little place.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Your body, your call.
Why is there no "our" here?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
No.
Oh, Jesus, no--
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I can't.
You want a hand?
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
I don't think it was them.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
Nice tent.
What movies?
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Yeah. Me too.
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--a Wiccan--
Cotter?
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
What--
Enough to keep sane.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Oooh. Oooh.
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Cotter'll kill you.
What?
She's off her fucking rocker--
Heather.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
She's far from "fine."
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
What happened to my Dad??
What was that?
Yeah? What happened?
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...But first I gotta know what happened.
Sure don't.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
Back where?
What "what"?
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Now that don't make much sense.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
What.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Yes.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Okay.
Okay?
No. not at all.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
You want to see him too, right?
Bull.
Yes? What is it?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
See my nipples?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
What do you want to do?
Beeeee careful.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I'm glad you do.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Go where?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Brilliant.
Yeah. but.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Who, me? Why should it?
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Que va hacer?
Nothing like this back home.
Surprise.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Tuna, this is crap.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
No?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
No, my brother.
Oh my G-d.
Diego Delgado, please?
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Yeah, I'm out.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
What?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Cocaine?  How much?
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
Un sapo?
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
What are you going to do?
Not mad.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Dad.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
Figured it out.
Figured it out.
Hello.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Kristina's fine.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Are we gonna split up?
How are you doing?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
You can call me Dad if you want.
California, huh?
Where are you going?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
But I've got school.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
No shit, Kevin?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
The strike is a success; but ...
Dien Bien Phu?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Third group.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
What's happened to you?
I don't even know your name yet ...
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Go away!
It's good nobody is following us ...
I think it'll be a success ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
But it's not even midnight yet!
What is she saying?
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
That's what my report will read.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
A massive cardiac arrest.
What induced it?
Like cats and dogs.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No questions.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
You've been following me?
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
A little after eleven.
I had some papers to pick up.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
How did he look?
Intense.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I had bypass surgery.
Why did she say she was leaving?
Can you give the court an example?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
She was.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Why?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Yes.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
What about Miss Lawson?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
No.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Yes.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
You didn't know about it before that?
You know I can't talk about that.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Something like that.
Hi, Frank.
Really?
Yeah.
You and me -- making love.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Can't it wait?
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Not even if they're a dork?
It had to get there somehow.
Oh Jesus.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Lawyer here?
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
Don't say that!
Well, I'd like to read them.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Then why do you?
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
They got heat in Michigan.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
That's it.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Pretty country.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
So, how long you've been living here?
This time of year.
Want another cigarette?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
My mistake. I apologize.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
No. I couldn't.
Trouble. Why?
Yes, thanks.
What do you want me to say?
STOP IT!
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
But now that you have it -
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
What time is it?
When did she decide this?
It clearly states in the will --
You people really don't like dogs.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
I said, no thanks.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
Cinn?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
Jimmy Bones?
You haven't?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Gimme the gun.
I didn't expect --
Not bad.  What for?
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
You mean they weren't up here?
It's impossible!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
Violet!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Shut up, Violet.
But everybody is all right.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
You're doing everything yourself?
Curious, maybe.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Why?
...  I needed that.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
What's wrong?
Shit, here we go.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What did Gino drink?
Where will you be?
Why?
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
How'd it go?
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I don't know what we're talking about.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
I think so.
Are you Treadstone?
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
You have your passport?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Yes.
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Yes.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
He came to kill us.
You knew he was coming.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
You could do that?
xxxxxx
You have ID?
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
What?
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
What?
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
How did I get here?
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
What? You mean you've got ...
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
Too late? That's for me to say.
SAM! What a surprise!
Ah ...
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Christ! You do know it all!
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Why?
If you say so.
It's you ... it's you ...
Ow! That hurt!
It's my fucking life.
I didn't like it.
We've got both.
Well, terrorists of course.
Turn!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Shit! The house is on fire!
It's not our mistake!
Information Retrieval.
The refund for Tuttle!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Sam Lowry.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
I won't be held responsible.
This isn't rare!
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
This is an emergency!
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Have you got one or haven't you?
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
You know each other a long time?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Here, you try.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
No.
She should go home.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
Five years.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Don't seem so bad to me.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
This is not a good time.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
What do you think?
He was tough. You did all you could.
Whadda we bring?
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Oh, God, no!
Hi.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Okay.  Let's do me.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Did you shoot their boots?
We can cut back at the end.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
As good as humanly possible.
Do you feel good about it?
I lost six pounds...
This is important to me.
No.  You know that I'm not.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
So who's the guy?
Okay.
Do it then.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
What did he say?
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Bad manners.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Hi.
If we could just eat first.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
You okay?
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
Well, when?
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
You want to come?
Take it easy.
Don't you work here?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Alright we're clear.
Anything new?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's up, Walter?
Oh yeah?
Did you hear what he said?
Why not?!
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Maybe so...
Don't ask.
I know.
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Well I was uh, just looking...
Where'd ya buy that?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Well, w-what did you do?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
Hello, Walter.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
Did you see my cat?
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Police officer.
Huh?!!!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
After that we go no more!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Don't grab me, okay?
Figures.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Let me in.
Yeah, I guess.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
You okay?
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
I do?  I guess I do.
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Hi.
Where are you gonna go?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Thanks.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
I crashed your party.
Are you okay?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
) What do you think?
I forgot.
You look way pretty, Kim.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Cramps?
None of your business.  God.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Who we gonna beat?
What!?!
Fine.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Don't start with me again.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
There isn't time.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
My parents have money...
You think so?
Buffy?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
So, we're stupid now?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I am.
God, I never thought of that.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Get over here.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Yes I do...
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
--but you're father's in there!
It's Skip, for you.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
I'm Crash Davis.
See my hips?
Damn.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Crash...I want you.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
God bless you.
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Don't bump me.
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
I didn't spit on you!
Why you shaking me off?
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Well, I held it like an egg.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
He did know.
Naw...
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Go for it.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
It's time you started working on your interviews.
What do I gotta do?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
What's wrong?
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
What?
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
It's a league record.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
You were in the m- You were in the building.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
You mean, I have your permission?
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Hello.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
...don't do it to me...
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
No, a...
What are you -
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
And what'd she want?
How'd you know I was here?
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Yeah, she's here.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
Why not make them happy?
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
Hey, Mitch.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Yeah.
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Hi. Nice to see you.
Oh, fabulous.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
...under?
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
I bought him a watch too.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Oh...
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You understand? What? Let you go?
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
Not gonna let me in?
Should I let her in like - ?
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Well...
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
No, Sir.
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I just wanna get out of here.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Yeah.
Mm.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Yes.
Well, I've been busy. 
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Carmine left?
Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
I'll be right out.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Mm, you want to steal it? 
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
I did what you told me to.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
A sponsor.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
All right. Be careful.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Yeah.
He called you right here.
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
There's more!
Two.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Frankie!
Charlie M.
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
You're a little confused?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
My fuckin' head.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Hi.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
You're probably right.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
What did you think?
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
I've been looking for you.
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Even the skylight?
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
I loved you.
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Did you try to kill...
But I'm blind.
Maybe.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
Where do you think you're going?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
What if they do question the authenticity?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
You never miss a trick.
You switched license plates?
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
I thought you said you could handle him.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
You won't disconnect.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
A woman?
Hey drop it, okay?
What do you do for a living?
Not a chance.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
God, if he doesn't come back --
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
A typical fuck-up.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
259-7881.
Do you think they'll walk away?
They did some great job of reforming you.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Naturally.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Didn't we play this scene before?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Who are you working for?
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
308-9962.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
And then?
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Who's this?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Why are you picking on me for?
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Undercover.
Scottish?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
She's not a girl, Col --
See what, Dil?
Good thing in a man.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
No.
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
What was that?
What was that all about?
Perform?
What look?
What's that about?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
What do you think?
Want to look after you.
You mean that?
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
You could?
When?
Kind of wish I didn't.
A little.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
Shouldn't be, Dil
What you doing, Jimmy?
Why?
Come on...
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Good-bye, Dil
You killed my Jody?
You didn't.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Dil!!!
Yes.
Yes. Now.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Please, Dil --
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Hey -- what's he like?
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
I heard.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
So you did fuck up.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
You may be right.
Jude?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
You sure?
And do you know why?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
I'm sure.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Right.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Hey --
What makes you think that?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
They won't let him die.
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
No.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
What?
No?
You make a nice couple.
Now put it back in.
Doesn't matter where.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like what?
Having two pints in the Rock.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
Depends on what you believe in.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Don't know her.
What?
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
The teddy bear?
Not here.
I never know nothing.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
What?
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
Adam --
Let's look anyway.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Reggie -- listen to me --
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Agent.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Thanks very much.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Agents.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
It's Charles!
Very good.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Scobie?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
You did.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Who?
What? Assassinate somebody?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Meaning what?
What do you want?
Tell me what?
Leave me alone -- !
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
I don't understand.
Oh, la.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Voil what?
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Quitter.
How's that?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Now you're angry.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Shakespeare never said that.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
We'll find you a hotel.
Hallo, Peter.
I'm still having trouble with English.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
How would you like a spanking?
Peter -- are you all right?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
He knows everything.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
What?
Yeah?
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
is there anything you do?
How much further?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No?
Are you sure?
No.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
You can't tell your parents.
No.
Cut it out.
Are you O.K.?
I do not.
Jody. Wait.
What?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Did he say anything else about her?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
Why not?
His mother's side.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.

...that is going to explode...
Oh...
Great. 
That's my business.
...Darlene pay you in cash?

Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
Peace.
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
Come on, get in the truck.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
 Excuse me...

You stole this truck.
...the ice cream for money!
I ain't playin' that.

What?
 Nice job back there.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...you.
I did not steal the truck.
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Oh, shit.
Come on.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Night Shift, but you might...
 ...shit!
Hey!

Okay.
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah...

You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!

What?
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
So I took his truck, yeah.
 Yeah.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Hey.   Mason.
Yeah.
 
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.

Go, go, go! 
Okay...
Whoo!
Forty-nine point four.
What?

Hold this. 

What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...-tiatin'.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
 big balls.
Hey, be cool.
We're worried...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
...-lem too?
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Exactly.

Any of them Richard Long?
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
"I am become Death, the...

You look fit...healthy...
Mm-hm.
...you were right, of course.  But after...
...always done, Richard?
Almost quaint.
So far, ye-yes.
Brynner.
Good to see you again, Leo.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
I'll do it.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
...-ther orders?
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Shit.
Get your links set up!
We were called in by the Jerome base...
Richard Long.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
...to die for a country that's...
Hello.


Where's Elvis?!
You'd never understand!
Goddamn it, Ma-...
Yeah?
Be sure you feed Bosco.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
...now!
...tight!
What's going on, colonel?
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Who's your suspect?
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Mason.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
...-son.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
You find yourself wearing a...
So you don't remember...
...seriously.
Lying? 
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
Let me see your...
...there's a colonel...
Just go check the temperature.

Arlo.

 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
Sir?
How did she get that idea?
Who's the investigating officer?
None.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
What does this mean?
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Oh, my, yes.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
What's that, Curly?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Call me Jake. How is everything?
You sure this is okay?
Hello, Jake.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
Or her name?
No. It was an accident.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
I guess not.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Of course.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I should talk this over with your husband.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Why?
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
They can't be.
I gave everybody the night off.
When was the last time?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Hold still. Why?
And I want to know where.
The Albacore Club.
You bastard.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
The police?
What does it look like?
Sure.
Going somewhere?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Ida Sessions.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
I'm sorry, I --
You're a married man, am I right?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Well, you never know, do you?
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Why? What do you mean?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Yes. 
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
So what's that got to do with it?
Go on!
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
Ready for dinner, Brad?
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
It can wait.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Get out, both of you!
You're no Venus de Milo.
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
Poor Mr. Carter!
Good.
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
I'm drunk.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
What check?
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
What about that apartment?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Why?
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
I'm giving him his ring back.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Let me take you out tonight.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
I left like an hour ago.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
We did.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
That's easy to say from over here.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
Shit!
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Did you tell Veronica?
Seven months.
She called you Brad?
She called me Brad.
That girl was vile to you.
You think things would be any different now?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
What did he say?
Nudie booth?
Let's hear it.
What?
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Exactly. They drank it all.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
You hate people.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
I can't fucking believe you!!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
What?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
No way!
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy to get a fine?
What did she say?
I'm not.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
Hey, what about Veronica?
You're a snake.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
This life.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Thirty-seven.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
What responsibility?
Leave me alone.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Like ten after.
Do you work tomorrow?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Yeah.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
With you? I don't think so.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Meaning?
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
Why did you agree to come in then?
How much money did you leave up there?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many what?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Dante...
Let it go...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Really?  You're the best.
What time do you get finished?
I don't want to go back with her...
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Can I have your name please?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
To an Asian design major.
Really?
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're not?
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Twenty bucks?
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
A monkey?
It can't fly in this weather.
Go on, fetch.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Not on that leg.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
I don't expect you to understand.
Why are you yelling?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Gabe!?
For the same reason you did, to help.
No luck?
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
You said there was a way across.
Travers, you're not running things.
Is it set?
What's the code, Travers?
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Keeping fit then?
Aye.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Let me get up.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
No, sir.
You're absolutely right, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Oh.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
I was quite enjoying that.
How many did I get right?
You're not cured yet, my boy.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Don't read it - sign it!
How many to a cell?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
You need a vacation.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
I'm...fine.  Fine.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
No.
You know Dmitri?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Can you finish on schedule?
Something going on?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
I never bought that.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What's he sayin'?
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Let's not get excited, sir.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
How long you think this'll take?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Why not?
Max.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What'd he do to you?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
So what?
Collateral damage.
I never learned jazz.
You mind?  I'm working here.
Leave me alone.
Yeah?  What happened?
I'm sorry.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
Who's Heller?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
And you believe me...?
None of your business.
Who?
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
You bit someone's nose off?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Equitation.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Can you prove any of this?
Shoot.
So what's the question?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Jerry, I --
Now's not really the time to get into this --
You look great.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
He gave it to me.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Liza?
Geronimo is down.
<u>Liza</u>!
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Excuse me?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Terminal?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Working.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
Wasn't my idea.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
What do you suggest?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Dr. Arroway --
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
So?
I'm willing to take that risk.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
What does it say?
What's the status of the decryption effort?
No primer.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
This is how you see the sky?
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Could we hear to China?
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
I'd say this is slightly different.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
Ellie.
What day?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
What'd you think?
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
You're trembling.
What?
I can't do this --
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
But --
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Here, Mom.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Tell us about it.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
A cold drink.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Luke. Where you goin?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
That fool. That damn fool.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Man Oh Man.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
What did I do?
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
You bastard!
We'll get the paramedics...
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
What pattern was that?
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Is it an ongoing case?
How do you know that?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
What's that siren?
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
Yes.
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
I heard. Good police work.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
What the hell you need her for?
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
Give me Ruben back...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
Detective Niccoletti?
He's not treating her right...
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Did you come?
Not a lot of action here.
Do you find him attractive?
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
No.
You're kidding.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
You look beautiful.
You're slowing.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
I gather he's late as usual.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
Letty.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
You took bets on my diagnosis?
Don't take it personally.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
He asked me to marry him.
What have you done with the ring?
We're supposed to be asleep.
What else would you do?
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
I love the pillows.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Sounds grim.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Promise?
Are you OK?
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Can you loan me a 20?
Are you all right?
I love him.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Here's the ring.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
Agent Hadley.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
He missed three weeks.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Why is everything an argument with you?
You want Zero to kill him?
This is Zero.
What'd you get?
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
The map said to go left.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
We've got to get out of here.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
Me?
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
No shit?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
Holy shit.
The money isn't here.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You ever hear of jet lag?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Who's gonna see it there?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
What's it to you?
I'll never live as a thief!
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
What do you think?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
Let's stop a moment.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Let them look.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
Then, why did you come?
I'll look around and catch up later.
What happened?
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
I don't know...
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
This is a delicate matter.
It's only a flesh wound.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
It's just the dope, don't worry
Does she have a name?
Well, how's your friend?
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I wish to possess what you have now.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
You'll be alone.
I've got him if you want him.
"Our" Crow...?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
It's not really important.
You implied it.
It was fine.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Am I bothering you?
I have feelings for you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
You really want to know?
Where are you going?
I think that's for the best.
Please don't go.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
You don't know how to love.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
I'm sorry about that.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Where did you say she's from?
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
What was that?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Okay.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Where are you going?
Don't you want to change that?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You do?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
And you think she bought it?
What's wrong?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Why not?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
No.
What's your plan of attack?
I'm at your service.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
And that's why you're leaving?
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Ronald?
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Not at all. What's wrong?
What about her?
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Right after we played backgammon.
We played backgammon?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
You're a lucky guy.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
I love the smell of pine.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Oh, lots of times.
I got my wish anyway.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
What's her name?
Irena.
Where is everybody?
I think I should.  3000W?
Did you hear the child out?
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
I thought you were with Amy.
Amy, not that old tree!
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
It was on account of the birthday party.
And who did the voice belong to?
It was just a voice.
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
What'd you get for Christmas?
I'm your friend.
But where is that?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Can't you get it, darling?
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
A lady threw it to me.
It's a pretty ring.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
But I only came to give back the ring.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Anything's better than Mark.
He's a very talented musician.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Hey, did you get contacts?
Are those Mark's?
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
How'd it go with the cop?
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Hello?
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
No.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
About Mark? Carlton?
About Benito.
I do development for TV movies.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
What?
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
It's a matter of life and death.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
When's the last time you saw him?
Like what?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
No, I got it. It's okay.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
You at least owe me the truth.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
Worse than this?
I ate a guy last night.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
We can get a warrant if you like.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
We only live a few blocks apart.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
I need something to keep me awake.
Not really...
They don't speak English...
What is this place?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Dammit!
Im sorry...
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
I didn't realise...
No.  I, ah...
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Yes.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Don't say a .
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
No more than the usual.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
I'm not certain about...
Mr. President...
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
When does it break?
You're kidding.
Three years.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
What I told him to?
What do you mean by that?
The government
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
I don't think so.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Gimme a quarter.
Alan...
Oh... Thanks.
The Fidelity nonsense...
Oh... Hi.
You're not?
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
You ever use it?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
... How could I what?
You1re leaving, too?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
What?
That's a secret.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
Yes.
They're crucifying you out there.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
Hi.
I missed...
We're working on it.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
What is it?
Miss Henried, I think you better...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Women swoon!
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
Well?
Yeah?  Like what?
What?
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
This is stupid.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
But I love you.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Don't stop!
Okay.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
You really think I should forget her?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
My brother went here.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
What?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
So?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
But if he said no before then...
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
This play?
Yea, art thou there?
Visit from my father.
How soon can we get up and running?
I saved your life is what I did!
Jesus Christ lady...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Looking good...
It's not them...it's it...
You want ME to go up there?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
What did you do the my kids!!
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
A little to the left...
She fucked us both.
I'll get the boots.
Yes, Albert?
We're all going.
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did not!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Who? Who is?
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
He's real bad, Nick.
No. None of that.
You are his friend.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Hey, Nick...
Kind of. You didn't know?
Here.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
You're going hunting?
I... No. You do this for money?
You can do it, Sal.
I know.
I just wait. You know?
What else?
Forget Sal.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
Here, here! This is it!
No.
What do you mean, no???
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
What?
Listen, Nick --
You didn't get a deer?
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Merle gave me this?
What the hell's that for?
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
Yeah.
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
Yes.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
No.  I want to be with you.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
You never want to find out.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
But I like the new one better.
Howdy, Jabez.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Loan shark -- hey?
What do you want?
-- in gold.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
You know darn well it is.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
What -- what's on your mind?
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
I'll never get my washing done.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
Isn't that your own fault?
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
Mary! Come back ...
What's ailing that dog?
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
It is.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
Why don't you?
The past six months.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
Put it down now.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Oh...Where does he live?
...I've missed you.						*
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Powell?  What's going on?
Roy?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
How do you know?
Is that him?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Hey, don't take the car!
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I'm really shakey.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
You're really crazy.
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Do you still want the operation?
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I can't talk to him.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
... armed robbery ...
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What if I take you with me?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
They look like good kids.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Special to me, too.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
Mister Mulvaney?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
I'm glad it's okay.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
It's the cops.  Shit!
... The bodies out the door.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...

They're trying to come through the door!
Get over there!
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Oh.  Run.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Did Pop come down?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
What is it, Choco?
<i>I forgot.</i>
So what?
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Yes.
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
<i>What is it?</i>
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
I've already formulated a plan.
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
Hello?
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Really? Did you play in a band?
We are so fucked.
Many times.
Not really.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
We're covered on legal with that, right?
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
My brother.
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
Squash it.
Good morning.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Sal's gonna be mad.
What responsibilities?
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
This might take some time.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
I'll do.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Sal, I want my money.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
No.  What are you gonna do?
When?
Before I get off work.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Why you gotta curse?
I didn't know you could read.
Mister Seor Love Daddy is cool.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
Some are OK.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Mookie's OK.
How do you know this?
I like Mookie a lot.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Then we could try something else.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
Yeah. How'd you know?
Come over around seven.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Cool.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Who's Principal Collins?
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Whoa. What was that?
I will stop this car right now.
HARRY.
I didn't know that.
How do you know it's for us?
HARRY, can you hear me?
Do you want me to pet your head?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
A blimp.
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
I know I did.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Ready Lloyd?
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Right.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Oh, you're good.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
What are you doing?
That's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
That's the downside. There is none.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
He passed away three years ago.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Hey you two. Lights out.
What?
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Everything?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
Love it!
What does Leto say, Piter?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Basically...
Is this what you seek?
Things have been so serious here lately.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
As the legend says.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Are you a Fremen?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
We call that one Muad'dib.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
The <u>women</u>?
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Mmph?  Where am I?
You'll be sitting on the right.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
It's a damn good role.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
For this one, we need $60,000.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Could we moovf to table?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
I don't think he's a schmuck.
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
I just picked them up on the way over...
Stop!
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Those assholes.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
Yeah...?
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
At what point?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Yeah, so... ?
Yes!
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Ed --
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
This guy.
Mr. Pekurny.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
He made a mistake.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
I'm at the hospital.
Hi. Is Shari here?
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Yeah...
So?
Right.
Oh God, this is so weird.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Um...
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Ohh...
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Everybody's someone.
Kinda'.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
What?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Why me?
Yeah.
I know.
Good-bye, brother!
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
Me?!
You know what your problem is?
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Who's Shari?
No. Two times.
What...
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Oh!!
Mm.
What does that have to do with... ?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Yo --
El/ella -
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Dick... Dick,..
Having a problem with your eye there?
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
NO, that's fine
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Sure
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Uh-huh.
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
So... what do you have to tell me?
I did it.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Yeah.  I'm here.
Sherry... I love you.
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
I'm not like you.
People can see this.
For what?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
What do you want?
Can I get you a drink?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
You fuck for money.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
We talked.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Of course... But how?
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
You know him?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Yeah, that's Stens.
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
What about him?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
They shot him in his library.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
That's right.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Damnit...
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
So what's the point?
She is Lana Turner.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
No.
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
You, me and White, huh?
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
My daughter was a virgin!
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
I just called it.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
Nothing.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
I don't know what that means.
Listen to me--
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Who was that other guy?
What do they have to do with this?
Yes.
Yeah.
It's a SAT-tracker.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
I don't know what that--
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
I intercepted phone calls.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Where?
That wasn't so hard.
Goddammit--
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
How?
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
It's a little late for that.
What size?
Eight.  Size eight.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Why?
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Somebody took my blender.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
You should take this seriously.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Stacy, don't hang up.
I know, but listen--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
What happened to your head?
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
It's a brand new card.
My suitcase--
Sir?
I don't believe it is, no.
It's not?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
It's how he works.
Eat your fish.
I know.
How?
I <u>did</u> care how.
You're a moron, you know that?
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
--otherwise we may have to--
My shoe?
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Robert--
Where's Stacy?
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Dad!
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
It's okay to use the phone.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Calm down.
Jesus.
They're framing me.
Why would they--
Jerry--
You gotta--
To the cops?
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
I have a family.
Are you okay?
What happened?
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
We don't know.
What about the tape?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
That insults them.
You felt obliged to.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
You don't sew at all!
When were you least happy?
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Shall we be all right?
A broken car?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
What?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
In my room.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
How are you?
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Are you Hana?
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I liberated it.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Thought you'd never wake up!
What did you say?
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
I can see my wife in that view.
Your friend?
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Why?  Is he staying?
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I've been told that before.
Hey! -
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
For my hair?
What do I do?
So I follow the wires?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I was looking forward to this evening.
Go away.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
No.
Or my wife's.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
You have a car?
You're not taking me seriously.
Do you mind?
For God's sake.
Those are my clothes.
That's entrapment.
Lose something?
And--
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Nice spot.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
I'll need that.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Why don't we take oxygen?
You bought this for me?
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
The eight billion. From them to us.
What's that?
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
But would you--would you--
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
The sign of our partnership.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
No way.
But--
--You're a cop.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Tina was a wonderful woman.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
Where've you been?
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Tony Marvin.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
What's she doing here?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
This is a real nice place you got here.
Right.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
Yeah.
The judge came up with a number.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
You're a girl.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
Oh, yeah?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
Course I did.
So you think we got 'em scared?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Then I don't get anything either.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
You didn't care about my case?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Ross.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
You're married.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
What's going on in there?
She's one of the sick people?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Hey -- those are my files --
How?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
And I miss you.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
What's going on?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
It'll be fine, yeah.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
I can help them!
Barks his consternation.
Yeah ...
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
What is it?
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
What is it?
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Yes, you do.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
You mean a man you can control.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
I don't like this.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
About what?
Hyperdrive.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
We have no use for your kind.
What'd you say?
You rest now.
Where are you going?
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
Free your mind and return he will.
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
It won't get through the blockade.
Did you call the Zoo?
But we saw Earth destroyed.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Ooww!
You told me he was dead.
Don't lie to me.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Locked.
I'm here.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
I'm looking for somebody.
Is he coming?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Guenevere...
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Yes.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
And you cannot love me...
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
To me? But why?
No, no, of course not. You are young...
I'm not jealous!
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
What honey?
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Good morning Madame.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
She is going to be well?
Morning.
How are you today?
Is it coming out Willie?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Depression?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
You're kidding! Like what?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
So, what causes this?
Please go away.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Did he tell you about my party?
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Where's Regan's father?
Have you told him what's happening?
What's the difference?
Is she gonna die?
When can I have one?
I found it.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Do you not like him like daddy?
People get tired.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Oh, Christ.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
In time.
Ego te abslovo.
Is that too tight?
Dimmy, you worry for something?
No momma.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
It's possible. Possible however
That's to bad.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
...look down in pity...
Are you comfortable Regan?
It's our goddamn car!
Little slow tonight.
Swimming trunks.
Just the same.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Twenty years, Ma ...
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Fuck him.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
What do you mean?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family.  It's business.
Terrific.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No?
That's what we agreed.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
What's the matter?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Awe inspiring.
Hey, Frank.
So what do you think?
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Funny, huh?
What?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
Couple years.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
The tenth's out.
I don't know. Some disease.
Seventy-one
Jack, you're on television.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Yeah, fine.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
Sick?  How sick?
The flu.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
My watch is broken, too.
Don't take it personally.
We ran long.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
What's the problem?
We're a team.  We work together.
Where's my name?
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's wrong with it?
Nine?
Uh... good.
Oh, thanks.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Peggy Lee?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
I can't sing it anymore.
Is that important?
Thanks, Lloyd.
Thanks.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Black.  Labrador.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
You're upset.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Long story.
We outgrew each other.
Vegetables.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
The recent past.
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Drive.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
A few blanks?  Like what?
That's not the worst part.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
I took it from my fake husband.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Not anymore.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
I'm just having some fun.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
You'd have to start immediately.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What do you know about it?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
What are you doing?
Kate Reynolds...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Adelle?
Mr. Mintz.
I dont think youre hearing me.
No.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
Like what?
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?
What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?
You see, its like were in each others heads...
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
What?!
Its lovely...
I dont think so, thank you...
Need a nurse?
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
No, I didnt...thats great.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Dont  go, Jack...
Because thats where I live.
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
What are you doing?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Why not?
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Thank you...
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Not it...?
Worse, you mean...
Are you out of your mind?
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Not with what they pay me...
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Do I know you?
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
How'd you know it was me?
I had it at four.
He's made a few changes.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Are you alright?
What the --!
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Ben?
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
I'm worried about you.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
And they're changing into...
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
Back it down, Johnny!
I though we went over this.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
How's the IPO?
Front page?
Ben's still out there --
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
Feeling better?
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
You <u>were</u>?
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
What's going on?
Victor, your scar --
You said it was urgent.
Please don't make this personal --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
Okay to proceed.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Yes?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
A surgeon might...
Open it! Open it before they get here!
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
How does it look, Doctor?
Sabotage? I don't understand...
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Sort of.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
No.
Well, okay, it's -
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
GOT IT?
Yah, but this TruCoat -
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, don't be silly.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Just a general way.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh... A what?
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Yah, that can happen.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
but do you know that for sure without -
... I'm sorry, sir?
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
No, no, fax is -
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Good day, sir.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Stan Grossman called.
...Is everything okay?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Yah.
Stan and I're okay.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Well, they -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Mm.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
How's it look, Marge?
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Oh, pretty good.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
I'm sorry, Mike.
Yep.
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
So... they didn't...
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
...So?
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And his wife?
This is do-able.
He's at Norstar.
That wouldn't interest you.
Where's Tyler?
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
Does this sound strange to you?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Practicing what?
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
I found a new one.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
Can I come in?
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
You got about thirty seconds.
I'm sorry, but I...
Who did this to you?
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
What do you do, Tyler?
And, now it's gone.
...no ...no ...
What list?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
But a good strange.
Good answer.
You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You're okay with this?
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Promise you won't.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
Look at your hand.
It isn't... ?
We don't need him...
Hey.
Look...
I'm not asking you to.
"Applicant?"
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
What are you talking about... ?
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
I swear on my life, I won't...
You told me you'd say that, too.
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson!
Signs?
You were there?
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
What did you see?
Random, sure.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
May we come in?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Kalarjian?
What feeling?
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
That's why I was there last night.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Can't you open the door?!
You know what to do.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
"Next?"
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Huh?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Again.
Ninety.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
American?
You comin'?
You're gonna love it.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Huntington Beach, California.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
I know.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Who're you?
Hello, John.
Those men are all dead.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Fine.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
<u>What</u>!
No, I'm fine... really...
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
... What?... You don't want to commute?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
How have you been?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Uh... basement I think...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
No, I have to work.
Your name was picked.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
No... thanks... Listen --
My name is Parry.
<u>What</u>?!
I'm the one what?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Why did you do that?
That's O.K.
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
Parry...
Are there any questions?
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
In a bar called Hellfire.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
I advise you to let us go.
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
No just Parry.
How do you know him?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
I did, didn' I, El?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You treat me like I was.
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Well...
No. How much do I owe you?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Well, you seem very professional...
Oh.
I have to talk seriously with you...
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
It's not that bad.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Like what?
It's none of your business!
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
The day after tomorrow.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Is he?
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
What?
Will you let me talk to you, please?
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
What kind of doggy is that?
It is true.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
You better hold onto your tongue!
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Well, she was.
Miss Dupea.
Aaron, how you doin'?
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Hi.
A play-ya.
Who gives!
Why?
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
She fucks it all up!
I gotta go take a piss.
You gonna talk to him?
Wha'?
You here to see somebody?
She didn't say she had no man.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Your friend must be misinformed.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Unbelievable.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
God I admire you.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I wasn't asking.
Creasy, how old are you?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
This one's going to be even more fun.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Well, which one?
Funny old bird.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
No idea at all?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
I guess not.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Cash. I'm impressed.
I'd have been long gone.
And what was that?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Then he has.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
They bust you every week.
Because we can't.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
I'm sorry?
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I really should change.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Thanks for the great time.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
What is this....
They just left, sir.
Cabana one.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
The door was unlocked.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Two...
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
Jim Swarthout?
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
That was close...
All your friends call you Jazz.
You wish.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
Three hundred.
You okay?
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
Did he just say what I think he said?
Yeah, go on...
Fine!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Let me go out like a man.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Kill them.  Not quickly.
You'd said something about proof...
Only on a first name basis.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
So...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
No - no.
Boca?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Did you pick up the car?
Le sommes nous?
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
We must follow it.
There'll be someone else.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Morning.  Sometime.
Never trust a nigger.
Who is that guy?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
Suspicion of what?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
You want the red or the white?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
I been damn careful up to now.
What I know is what I told you.
Yeah.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Baltimore?
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
I love you, Bud.
Wish you weren't.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Hey, bud.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
No.  This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Uh, huh.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Deleon.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
You call your son Little Chief?
What'd you say your name was?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What?
It did, Pop.  It did.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
Tell me.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
You really wanna know?
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
How the hell am I gonna do that?
I got it.
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Go in where?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Uh, huh.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
You used to be on the job?
Who are you?
Who the fuck is this?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
Why don't we go take a swim?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
What're you doin'?
Barely.
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
I'm a slow eater.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Is that so bad?
What?
Did you stay here last night?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Could we move a little faster?
Faster!  Eat faster!
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
I never said you were "nothing".
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
....with a woman's touch.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
Why?
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Boy scouting.
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
Eight times.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
So let's talk.
What do you want?
It's going.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Good night, beautiful.
You're talking about my lady.
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
Really?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
That was truly excellent.
This is Jason's fault!
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
I demand to know what is going on...
What are you doing??
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
What is your location?
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
We must abandon.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Great game.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Yes.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
See, Daddy.
Your father said you might be here.
How prominent?
That's always been my problem.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
That's very lovely actually.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I am really, deeply sorry.
Washed away.
A thousand things.
Where the hell are you?
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
So what are you going to do about it?
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew's my grandson.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Because life is good.
Then they lost?
Why does it matter?
How come?
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
Yes.
And the Father replies?
What's good?
Endearing.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
So do I. Over and over.
Is what true?
But you're his friend.
Home.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
What do you want?
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
Perhaps some tea?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
It's over.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
What a pity.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
That's the last.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Often.
Surely you know what you have.
What a relief.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
It needs work.
The Mission Director.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
We can't stay here.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
How long?
How the hell did you get here.
I have your samples ready.
In case you get back before I do.
Vincent...Vincent...
Yeah.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
In the South Wing.
Come on.
What is it?
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
All it takes is a long arm.
I'll take care of my end.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
How does it taste?
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
Yeah.
He must have.
You've got it all figured.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
We got this far.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
No more about Beynon.
Oh, Jesus... how?
I don't know.
Where do we go from here?
That certainly makes you kind of special...
No, I'm afraid not.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Drive.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
That's what I want.
That right?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
How?
What happened to this car?
Why?
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Who paid you to see me off?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
So where are we going, Princess?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Entertaining.
You sure about that?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Yeah.
Now tell me the truth.
Yeah.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
Where you going to live, then?
Wilton Estate.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Who's Brumby?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
I won't be using the room tonight.
I see.
Are you a traveller?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
They came back?
They bloody hurt me.
Not much.
What you going to do?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
You're not seeing me?
I'll see you, then.
Deadbeats all.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You did?
We're stuck with this...
And it's not right to the customers.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
No.  That's absolutely right.
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What?
What do you mean?
Someone should hurt them.
Well.  Well...
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
You...
Dave.
That's ridiculous.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
I, you know, they should be insured.
I can't close 'em.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Why don't you think so?
Yes.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Excuse me, fella.
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Shelly, you blew the last...
Shelly...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...do you want to go downtown...?
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Can't do it.
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
Mmm.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Yes, I am.
Excuse me...
No.  It hadn't.
I've got the check...
I'm sorry.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
Shit.
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
They took the leads?
Which...
You're sure?
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
I'm sorry...?
Mm.
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
I've got to talk to you.
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Three days.
I don't understand.
When did you write the check?
You tell me again.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I'm...
What...?
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
Guess who?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
Where are you going?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What took so long?
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
No.
I don't want to stay here...
He is weak.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
It was hard to have him killed.
What is it?  Can I help?
We have time.
I've always taken care of you.
I'm going to see my parents.
How long does this go on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
He's not the same as when I met him.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
I asked about Fredo?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
How's the baby?
Yes, Michael, it does.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
I had no idea...
You would have killed his brother?
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
Not for a few years.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
I deny his every charge.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Trust me; do as I ask.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
And?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
What makes you say that?
Fuck you.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
I'm not married.
Of course.  I am married still.
Just that I was in the Marines.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
What?
No.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Did you kill anyone?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Sorry.  Not today.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
You first.
Everybody has stories to tell.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
It's not like her.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
You okay?
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
Fuck off!
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
No.  I expect you can't.
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Then the rumors are true?
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Can that count as one question?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Mr....Kay?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
What do you mean -- ?
What for?
You have my word...
No...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
Diane 1.
It's all microchips and shit ...
Peugot convertible ...
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
No.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Yeah... You want a ride...
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Hey, Kip ...
You sure you're okay -- ?
Yeah -
About what?
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
The era when crime didn't pay --
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
What are you doing here?
Where'd you find this one?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What are we gonna do -- ?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
So I was replaced by Mitch?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
No ... ?
I think so... They're just... So ...
Slip it in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Hear you roar ...
How is he -- ?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
You need him...
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
How old are you now, Toby?
What about me?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
What do you do?
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
What are you talking about?
Jezuz Christ!
We've got to help each other.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
Who's gonna do that?
Keep 'em coming.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
It's been six months.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Paulie's gonna make him?
You want the melon?
I better call again.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
It's a fait accompli?
He heard.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
But, Paulie, please.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do up there?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
Did she get my Double Burger?
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Chuck, let's go.
Codebreaking.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Yeah, can I help you?
What're you doing?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
Well, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
I do.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
I could go for a Whopper.
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
Probably not.
What did you think?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
285.
Yeah. Do you paint?
No.
Why thank you.
Well, are you going out again?
Haven't called her.
So Christ, call her up.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
No, I don't.
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Where were you?
That's right.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
What did you think?
I didn't ask for this.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
You want to read it?
Gotta go with the belt there...
I know.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I want to meet them.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Why do we always stay here?
Want me to take a look?
Like me?
Do you play the piano?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
So, do you play the piano?
No.
What?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Yeah.
You doin' the hirin'?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Will ya look at her!
But ain't no reason--
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Naw. They paroled me.
Maybe the road's out.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Yeah. On my way home now.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
They never wrote you nothing?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Sure do.
This here's a strike.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Got any plants?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
No.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Which ones?
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Please don't.
Now you done it! You busted it!
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Yeah...
Yes.
Not much else.
What's your business?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Bad experiences.
What's that?
Are you there?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Do you like the people you work with?
Is that right?
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
No...
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
That's going to cost.
You have.
I bought a new rug.
It's a place where religious people--
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Shit.
Poor thing.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Feel good?
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Fine!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
What?... Oh baby...
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Good.
Who's there?
Did you speak to Farlow?
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
What about Grace?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
We're very lucky.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Everything all right.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Yeah, what?
It's so cruel.
She calls him Tommy...
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
They fired you?
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Tom?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Can you drive?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
No!
You just showing off for her!
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
What stuff is that?
Now that's cool.
You think it's cool?
How's it going, Ray?
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
I want it to have my children!
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
What did we learn in school today?
Revenge.
Talk to me.
Crash Override.
I said give me time.
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
Yeah.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Dade.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
What is he doing in here?
Phreak?
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
When did you find this out?
Brady!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Can't you find somebody else?
How do we look?
You guys always look great.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
How many people in the bus?
What?
No.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
What are you doing out here alone?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
That's all the windows, Dad.
You knew. You just didn't care.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
I don't want to look pushy.
I don't know.
Call me.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Why?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
How's it powered?
What happened?
I have a place for that.
Hello?
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Yes, you can.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
What do we do?
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
I found the car! He's here!
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Are you coming over tonight?
Sure.
I don't like that story.
Why are they under there?
There was no one outside.
There WAS.
What did he look like?
Laurie, you come with us...
Yes, she is.
She's washing her clothes.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
What does that mean?
Pull up to the entrance!
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Are you really interested?
You want to see some?
Yeah.
Wow, it's the red one?
Uh...
Right.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Yeah.
When did you first notice this?
How ya doin', man?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
I'm...all right.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Elliot!
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
How about something to eat?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
I'm sorry.
I'm saying it now!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
But not you.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
How are you?
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...you know?  I, uh...
Isn't that great?
Go right over there.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Okay.
Oh, Hannah!
It's, uh, you never know--
Oooo.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
I know, no--  I know.
Uh-huh.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Hmm!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
You're too demanding.
What's the matter?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Yeah.  Me, too.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
I remember you.
I recall you.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Good.  How are you?
So how are you?
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Well...
Nobody ever said it.
You're kidding me.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Just a few minutes ago.
Mickey?
Mmm, what?
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
And?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
What have they got you doing?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
Bad beat today.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...the whole world's out to get you...
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
Hold up a minute...
You take this much time over everything?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
...sir...?
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
...they're from Baltimore....
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
What reaction?
Try Barney Clark.
He is...?
And how would you know that?
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
...here's to child abuse!
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Sir:
...what'm I looking at...?
A fellow with five fingers.
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Yes sir, I saw it. 
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
...long overdue.
...may be the heat....
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Don't shoot yourself.
...and that is what you need to expand.
I don't understand.
Then we cannot go.
...what did you want? 
I know where he is.
...<u>sadly</u>...
Hey, lost again.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Thank you.
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
...no...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
For approval.
...yes...?
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
Man, she's losing it...
What are you doing?
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Two billion years of evolution and                          ] you're what we've come up with--                            ] "Wichita"--the hot, cool, tell-it-                          ] like-it-is counselor with a dark                            ] side.                                                       ]
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Gee, thanks.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
I said I was sorry.
No way, no day!
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Did to.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
How do you turn the fucker off?
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.

That.
Poor Father . . .
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Yeah, how's that?
What's the occasion?
How much time off?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
What did you just say?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
What's wrong, Trev?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Morgue...?
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
Poor Trevor.
It's not that kind of date.
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
Bill, I got financial problems and...
Turn that thing off.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Uh, er... I...
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
Unprofessional.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
She's talking to him now.
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
What about?
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.

Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Everything breaks at once.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
You must value your independence.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
I've asked him what's wrong.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
How were we -- were we cool?
Did you hear what he said?
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
I thought we'd be happy here.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
Who was that?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
No.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Lieutenant?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Lieutenant.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No.  I don't scare easy.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
How long is the voyage?
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
I stood up first.
Agreed.
Different places.
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
To talk to you.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
Yes.  How did you know?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
About what?
Yes.
That makes you uncomfortable?
No.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
You stayed here again last night?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
What'd you find out?
You get anything on Smith?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
He needs a doctor.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Can you identify this man?
What hospital?
Yeah.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
Kevin left without you.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
How can we get out?
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
That's not enough.
Go.
She didn't answer.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
It's right in front of us.
Chief, Mikkelson.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
Are all of you named Jones?
What's my name?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Who are you?
What do you want?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
Paul!
Please, I don't use guns.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
What did you overhear?
What did they say?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.
Well rewarded Those were his words.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
Where are they going?
When?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
You fucking see that!
Lets go, Jock.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
They do not have your connections.
What is it, Paul.
I have a confession. When we met...
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
You have taken business class?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
Thank you, sir.
The staff and guests! How many?
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
I'm confused.
And what's Steven's status?
Jesus H. Christ!
What?
Three times, to be exact.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
What?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
What --
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Where is she?
-- and who's next on your list?
-- wit...nesses --
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
House 2, Guests 0.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
There is something very not normal going on here!
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Price!
Something....happened --
Damn it.
Town records are coming up now.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
By freeing them.
Oh my God!  She's in there!
The place is pretty dusty.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
A friend?
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
What?
What do you mean, unfortunately?
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
And what would you do?
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Wha .... ?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
Taken what?
I'll boil some water.
And he still sits there?
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
I don't know.  Maybe.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
What ... What ... ?
But how in God's name ...
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
But I said I was sorry....
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
I wanna know...
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Yes.
You certainly do.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Employer?  The president?
Why does this have to be so hard...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Well, maybe I --
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
I'm sure I --
Confused?
Smitty.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
...You son of a --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Phony, huh?
How long've you been down here?
My pleasure, sir.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
But, buddy --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
And Sid says you stole it!
Yes sir...
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
Not even behind your back?
But --
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Damnit, where's my car!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Old Faithful.
She's good, Bennie.
Good morning, miss.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
At the Houmfort.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Does she suffer?
I've never heard of a cure.
Where were you trained?
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
I am not a frightened girl.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
I've never given it much thought.
Why did you come in here?
I love Fort Holland.
Help me? How?
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
An accident at the mill?
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Don't start.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Elena, what are you're talking about?
I'm not surprised.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
If you're going to insult me --
In the car.
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
But...
I saw you on your bike today.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
You're not a psycho!
Yes.
That's right.
See ya.
Am I right or am I right?
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
The Idiot?
Maybe you should have just a half.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
Yeah?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Can I come?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Her name's Libbets.
Hood residence.
The ones you built?
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Just after Leland Street.
Yeah.  All over.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
No.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
They're all over everybody.
He's just rattling your cage.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
I don't know.
Since grade school.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
She wouldn't tell me!
Oh?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Down at the station?
No.
Yes.
Surely you know the one who made you...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
I was waiting for you...
You said there were none.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Yes... My God...
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
And yet you knew what I would o.
More.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
Stop her Louis!
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
What was that?
The ship is sailing wihout us!
How do I look?
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Yes...
Did I hear a yes?
Take him.
Dear God, what have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
I didn't want to kill her.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
It's just a room...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
You found nothing?
Yes...
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Listen to me. He's here.
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
That was heart attack time, Karla.
There's nothing between Will and me.
No.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
No way.
Yes.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Julie...
I'm holding your hand!
Checking the locks again?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
To get out of Southport?
What?
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
I trusted you.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
Well, there's some flaws in her...
You guys lost?
We'll only be a second, okay?
What is up with that weirdo?
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
Woman, what are you doing here?
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Do you mind if I go with you?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -
Who?
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Sit down? What are . . .
Not a soul.
I know. I know.
Mother . . .
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
There it is, good as new.
Hee-haw!
What boat you sailing on?
She's swell.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Well then, how do you know?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Aw, forget it.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
Oh . . .
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Maybe you were born older, George.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Hey, George . . .
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Why didn't you call me?
All of it?
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Pop!
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
Do I look as funny as you do?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
You may kiss my hand.
Ouch!
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Oh, George, George!
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
You can?
Sure you do -- you win either way.
It's okay, it's okay....
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Maybe by now they are.
Throw it.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
Good morning!
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Mike's out there.
Do I have to?
Because.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
The what?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Why?
Let's get the kid home.
Mrs. Silvera?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
That you were fired.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I'll give notice.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
They made me go with them.
That's you.
Now I really want to see it.
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Terry!  You okay?
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
Next week.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
Maybe.
Don't feel bad.
Well, not much longer to go.
Don't forget you have your brother.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
No.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Where are you going?
Are you coming...?
Michael...
After what happened to us?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Change your mind?
Finally.
Okay.
... Mean through the tubes?
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
... He ought to put him in here.
Michael, take deep breaths.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
I am.  You're not.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
I'm sorry.
No!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
She, Mister Hutton.
Sure.
Yeah, from Boston.
'Course they're also so rich.
I don't know, what else is there?
Take it up!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Five hundred yards.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
It sure is good to be home....
We need milk....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
What's wrong?  What happened?
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
A big one....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
Sit down, Ma....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
They had them on the big one....
Bad boy....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
You sure you've done this before?
How long has he been here...?
Who?
I didn't ask you to....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Shit....
I don't like the song.
I'll do it, Jake.
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Oh no--
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
Yeah, he can go ...
Not too good in daylight ..
How'd you do it, old man?
What do you mean?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
No, you didn't.
So am I. But where's my money?
Pay me, and I shut up.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
Why's she blind, Bro?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
What exactly you doing, John?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Yeah, I guess I do.
What was she like?
How you doing on those shoes?
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
No.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Can I help?
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Well, thanks.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
That took guts.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Beer okay?
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
We will be fine!
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Right.  I'll come in.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
Thank you.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Not everyone has what you have.
I have to ask.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Oh, tell the story.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
You wanted smaller.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Jerry --
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
You couldn't have made that jump.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
You rented an automated litter box.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
We could co-write a paper.
We need to keep moving.
I CAN GET HIM!
He used to know me.
I try not to.
Good luck with the fund raising.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Are you sure?
But then you never get to go in space.
Bonitas.
You should.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
I have never been on this island!
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You are an academic.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Are you looking for a problem?
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Is that kid still bothering you?
That was about a year ago.
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
You've broken its leg!
We took to the rock.
What's he got in there?
I have to find Kelly!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Once we have control again we - -
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
What are we looking for?
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
Why?
You want to talk about this?
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
It's safe.
All night?
Please!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Well?
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
That's not funny.
You want to put in chain saws?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I don't know...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
He... he's here...
Quite a circus.
_Krueger_...
Who's chest?
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Well?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
What's that?
What happened? Where's Jason?
You work in the insurance department?
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
What an extraordinary request!
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
I usually take lunch by the River.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
Tonight?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
-- Listen to me --
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
You look tired.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
This is filed incorrectly!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Father!
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Holy God! The mummy walks!
I can't imagine you crying.
Jack!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
They' re dead.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Did you see her?
That's your monkey, Denham.
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
What?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Why? She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Yes?
Do you always have to repeat?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
No.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
Mm.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
With Trina.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
What?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Well as a matter of --
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Nobody's seen that.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest...
Show.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
When is mommy coming back?
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Then eat around it.
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Objection.
It's my name too.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Uh, huh?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Objection!
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Somewhere in between.
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
What?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
He looks like a terrific kid.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Wow!
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
Right.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Fine.
What?!  She wants what?!
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Three.  And add some basil.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
She ever ask about me?
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I do, now.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
I have.
Holiness?
How big is Tibet's army?
Is that big?
No. This war is almost over.
And, America?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
Good day.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
What does the butter spot feel like?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
This is Britain.
Ahh.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
No.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Keystone what?
Cocktail?
Was he a good man?
What's that?
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
Such the flirt.
I'm okay.
Guess I finally got bit.
I'm not making it up.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
You flew up here because your boss--
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I didn't say it like that.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
You're mushing it a little around the--
Watch out!!
If I'm ever in New York...
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
What's that?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Not yet.
I got nothing against--
They don't believe her.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
<u>You</u>?
What'd I do?
Boy, is that smart...
No. He won't come after me.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
All that detail, just from memory...?
All flayed...?
I didn't.
I never thought about it.
Who killed your patient?
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
A moth... How did you predict that?
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Go, Doctor.
Killed outright?
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Why so briefly?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Dr. Lecter -
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Are you alright?
Let us go, miss.
Why didn't you bury those people?
The Ottawa are gone.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
Sorry to disappoint you...
Are we safe?
Where will we go?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
That is the truth!
What did you say?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yes.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
We're getting out of here just in time.
It's got Hazy!
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
Sixpack?
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
What can we do?
They know, don't they?
How much time does that give us?
It hit me!  Where are they?!
I'm going inside.
You got money in this tub?
Yes sir...
What the?...
So that's all you do?...
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
Who cares?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
What are you going to do to him?
Sixpack...
The shack...
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
Well?
You get the guns?
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
JD.
They were going to pay, then?
All right, Dad.
Is that you, Dean?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Dog, I have found the cash!
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Invitations?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
That's it all done, we are off.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
I hope this is the right move.
Why, what's up?
Tom?
For half a million?
And?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
They stole our land--
You think I can't learn that?
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
No, sir--
I'm sorry, sir.
Do whatever they tell you--
I do, sir.
Because it's a job?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
How's business?
That the word on our boy?
A .45--
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
I'm not picking it up.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Hey, it's the General.
You've been in this house for a while?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
So how come you got into all this?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Tanks, huh?
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Right.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
It's a .45.
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
You get much of that in here?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
When we backed you--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Right.
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
You go by your old house?
Sam--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Well, you hire illegals--
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
A little older than Paloma is now.
Thank you.
That's me.
I've seen 'em.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Mom?
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
It was for personal consumption.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
They've got my Amado.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
I should get back.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
They got telephones.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
No--
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
I know you?
Otis what?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
I don't want him getting in the way.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
He was the real thing, right?
Stuff?
He taught all this to Swann?
I told you --
No.
What then?
It's okay.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Are you sure?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
Is it finished?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
... they believe you.
What were you doing up there?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
--vanished.
Trickery and divinity.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Are you a gambling man?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
She has no real grip on reality.
You need an ambulance.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
You know Vinovich?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Yes?
I don't know.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
No.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Fuck you.
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Not true.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Try twenty-five.
Philosophy.
Oh, hi.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Really?
No, you smiled.
No, I was looking at you.
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
That's ok.
We established that we have no communication.
That's too scary.
You are.
Nice one.
Working.
I'm sorry.
Well... have a good flight.
Hello, darling.
Like Japanese food.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Hello?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
What?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Hello? Yes?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
See you later.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
It's amazing  there!
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
What?  That's horrible!
I'm still shaking.
I can't believe Will killed him.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
I found them in your file box.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
He spoke to you?
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
What are you looking for exactly?
What's the bible for?
We're going to do this.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
What about after?
Plenty of time.
What are these?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
What's the matter with you?
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Hi.
Whatever.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
No I don't.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Wait...
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
To do what you love.
I don't know sometimes.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
They ever love you back?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Thanks, Sidra.
Just wanted to say good game.
I know.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
One, up.
He works at a bank.
I don't care.
Way to hoop.
Your legs don't look broke.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
With a jacked-up attitude.
He ain't Spalding.
Yeah.
You're not stupid.
Who's nobody?
Hey, what's up.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I never asked you to choose.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Actually, I don't...
A rest?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
You're out of your mind.
With who?
At one in the morning?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
We were just studying.
You hearing me?
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
No.
No need for braces, Donnie.
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's a helluva disease.
Yeah, hey. Chad.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
...Hello...?
...yeah...
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
ok.
Bit messy.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
-- do you wanna cup?
I'm sorry, Claudia.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Well...is that illegal?
It's my favorite place --
ok.
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
What?
It's ok.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Just say no.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
Diet Coke.
Ready to go,go,go?
I don't know.
What happend, what's going on?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DAD --
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --

Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
Do you have love in your heart?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
I have love.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
...please...
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Yes I do.
I need to sit down.
Who are you gonna call?
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
No.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
All it takes is one second?
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
the valley?
I'm sorry.
people die.
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
Calm down.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
I AM CALM.
You're here.
What the hell is this Marcie?
Then what?
Yes.
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I love you.
No.  No.
That's it.
How long with Paula?
Do you know the answer to this?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
I don't know what I've done.
I'm Bob.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
What's MOW?
Are you on drugs right now?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Bottled Water?
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
We need more dog food --
You coulda been in front --
I'm fine. nothing.
Hi.
Hi.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...what...?
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Now.  You were saying?
Where are you going?!
Aramis, this will never --
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Everyone back.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness.
Mother of God!
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
But why?
Who does?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
It's been too long.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Forgive?!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Eh?
What number, on the first page?
... Nothing.
Did you know... about Raoul?
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Captain Doyle?
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
What do you think?
What the hell happened?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
And he took a swing at you?
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Who is it?
Speak of the devil.
Where up north?
Jesus, man...
How about Marvosa and the others?
Where are you going?
Don't you guys ever knock?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
In thirty-five minutes.
Book code?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Somebody hurt him?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
As long as they're dead...
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
For Christ's sake, why?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Who is it?
I'll pick you up in...
It does, doesn't it?
How far away's the back-up?
I'll get my purse.
I'll see you later. All right?
Do you feel privileged?
Do you see?
Yes.
Not me.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
You'll let me go now?
Absolutely,
Do you have it?
I want to see Lecktor now.
It's Will Graham...
Hi, Linda. ..
Yeah...
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
I don't think I'll tell you.
Most people are.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
What happened to them?
What about the dog?
Molly?
To do what?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
You haven't smoked in two years.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Will?  You could come up here.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Lt. Fisk said...
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
She got all right?
No.
And?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
You had disadvantages.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
No.
No.
People love... comedians.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Andy!
I'm sorry, George...
How long would they let me sleep?
But wasn't it funny?
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
B-but... we saw... your neck...
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Cue the commercial!
Hi...
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
So?  What do they know?
It's so dirty.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Sure...
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
Lieutenant?
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Don't be ridiculous.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Do you always look at it encoded?
... Yeah.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Dead.  All dead.
All right --
Hello?
The agents --
What do you know?
It's an honor.
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
... am I dead?
She would say she knows enough.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Tank.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Yeah.
That vase.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
What?
Hello, Neo.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Why?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
We can't leave him!
I'm going in after him.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
No.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
What are they doing to him?
How?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
What do they want?
You're not far from Cypher.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Why?
Uh...can we give you a check?
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
She don't look Jewish.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
OK, ok...
Oh Michael, look...
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
Did you?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Count it.
Come on.
Hey... you got stereo.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Just keep him quiet.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
He's coming.
Just plain 'Joe'?
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
What about the Mayor?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
...See you tomorrow night.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Drew, you're out of line.
Here...
As close as a deal could be.
Yeah, something he goes by --
'Joe...'
Is there any more to it?
I am now.
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
What are their feelings?
Certainly, Bill.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
Yeah, that's what he said.
Obeah.
Not time yet.
Yes.
You loved back?
Good morning, Jennifer.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
I didn't know that.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I've got plenty of friends.
Yes?
I don't know.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
The 'coffee shop' --
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
No --
Yes, Bill.
Yes.
No.
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
And more.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I'm her father!
Uh --
Thanks.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
An offense --
Yes.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I'm sorry, I --
Please.  Talk to me --
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
I want to have a look around before I take you.
'Take me'...?  Where?
Time.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
We're all here, Bill --
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
You're terrible.
What is it, Daddy --?
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Then what will you say?
I love him.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
No, it was so right it scares me.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
47.
Burt.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
When was I in here?
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Who did this to you?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Take the money and walk away!
You know him?
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
I'm not.
Help me.
How?
What?
Yes.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
My wife.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
Are you Teddy?
You've read it a hundred times.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
You don't know him?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
What do you mean "bad news"?
Like what?
Why?
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
No.  I was in Namibia...
Oh, yeah...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
Yeah?
We're not certain...
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
You do.
We want it back.
Okay.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
So where's the best place for mojitas?
How's he not your husband?
No.
I insist.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Good samba dancing...?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Stevens?
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
Where the hell are you, man?
Where'd you go?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
What's the point?  It's going down.
From whom...?
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
So?
Okay...see you soon.
What flowers?
Okay.
So lay it out, my brother...
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Lotta rich women back there...
Must be some mess back there.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
And what?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
These guys're good drivers.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
You bet I do, sir.
Uh, yessir.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Getchmis olsun
The kids? Why are they...
How's your hernia?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Shit.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Where you staying, Dad?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Where are the minefields?
Stupid.
Girlfriend?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
And you?
That doesn't seem so bad.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
What?
Never was anybody like you...
Work, work, work, that's all do
Jeremy...
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
What?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
I pull.
He didn't do it!
Just inner chambers...
It didn't bite me.
Peter-
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
What are they...?
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
What's your new book called?
The phones are working?
My daughter must be going nuts.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
--not fair?
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Well, it certainly says you.
What?
I'm glad you like it.
Yes, Paul.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
What?
They're hauling Misery into court.
Just leave it, all right?
What is it?
So do I...
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Not much luggage.
Well that depends.
To do what?
Fight a bit of a cold..
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
It is, Billy.
No.  Should I?
Uh-huh.
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Which is?
So where did I got right?
Damn, you're beautiful.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
-- his left jacket pocket.
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
Are you okay?
What did you think you were doing!
Why did you phrase it like that?
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
That simple, huh?
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Now how to get in there.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
Come on!
What kind of show.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
All ten million.
There was nobody on the bridge.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
I dont think so.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
Why don't you come back with me?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Mm - Hmmm...
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
What was your deal with Job?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
Then what am I doing here?
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
What problem?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
You got it.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
What's going on?
Jack you're so wicked.
Connection denied.
I always check the batteries.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Are you ready?
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
What?
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
What's your news?
It's temporary.
You are going to marry my brother?
How'd he die?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Yes.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
She didn't like me.
What did you do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Snap out of it!
What?
Hi.
It's the best thing there is.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
He didn't come!
This is your place.
Yeah.
No.
No. I'm gonna wait.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
I shouldn't.
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Have you told her we're getting married?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
How's the mother?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Did you see it?
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Temperature's dropping.
People home.
You mean the whole house?
My God, it's a mansion!
It's a house.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Does wood sink in water?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Please!
King of the WHO?
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right!  What do you want?
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Well, what's that then?
You'll what ... ?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Bedevere, my Liege.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Nu!
Ni, ni, ni!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
It is the rabbit.
What?
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Shut up!
Yes, Lord.
The nose?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is the capital of Assyria?
Don't be such a baby.
Why?
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Do you want to come and have a drink?
Father, lad.
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
I don't want land.
What?
No, It's nothing!
Oh ... hello ...
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
You got my note!
Well ... yes ...
You've come to rescue me?
Oh!
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
No, no, no.
How much?
Not bad, not bad.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
You watch your tongue.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
You should have someone look after you.
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
A situation?
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
It's so infernally cold in here.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Then I envy yo.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Yes, ma'am.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
A fine choice, sir.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Why was I not informed?
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
I have a letter, ma'am.
From whom?
Where is my son?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
How do you do that?
It's the game, ARCADE.
So where is he?
It's twelve-thirty!
It is.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
The Police, then...
What?
You mean we learn the rules...
And beat it at it's own game.
Virgin sacrifices?
No I'm not...
Put in a quarter.
You don't get it, do you?
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
Christ...no time...
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Give her a chance, will you?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
I'm going home.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
So what's the problem?
Whatever.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
That's okay.
Yes.
Hi.
No, no, I'm fine.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Betty.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
No.
Unh, unh.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
There's nothing?
"You're still here?"
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
You're so easy.
The one of 'em still alive?
Hardly.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
Is that it ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
So what do we do ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
So why this ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
He hired you to build this place ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Do you know where you're going ?
What about you ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
What do you mean sir ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
Will he make it out ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Do you want to go out with me ?
Hello.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
He was right behind me !
Why don't you shut up now.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
What do you remember about her.
Visualize a spare?
So, what's on your mind?
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
So you're saying...What are you saying??
I already bought a ticket.
She just had a baby that's all.
I don't know if I want to.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Hello.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
He's writing. Hello?
Your mother?
You're over reacting!
MOM!
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
WHAT??
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
What if you don't wanna be found?
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
I think it's cool.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Write me a poem?
No?
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
Excuse me?
Something wrong?
You couldn't?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Arthur!!
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
The boss is watching us...
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Does it make it easier to win?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
No, why?
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Pointing upwards Look...
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Ahem.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Hi Vada.
He was allergic to bees.
What??
Really?
Do you miss her?
Oh come on.
Will you tell her I came by?
Sure.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
What do you get for that?
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
He's allergic to everything.
Shut your big fat mouth!
Did you read ALL these books?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
I'm allergic to it.
Uh huh.
At what?
Your lip bleeding?
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Well when you get older, you just have to.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Would you think of me?
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
I can see why.
I was devastated.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
And you believe that.
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Elmer's Glue?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Ju...
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
But he always says...
Exactly.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Don't you see...
... look good on Kimberly.
Is anybody watching?
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
Well, you're a little early...
Waiter! Check, please!
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
You never eat when you're despondent.
Don't you throw up on boat?
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
Does that make it right...
Thank God you were here.
What's up?
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
I never forgot that.
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Right here.
I hate that music.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
No.
I said, I've been real tired.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
How is that?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Have you talked to Triplette?
He has that sign with the tree.
You want anything?  A drink?
What's he running for?
D.C.
President?
You're kidding.
Howdy.
Hey!
Your brother?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
How in the world did he get shot?
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Hi, Sherry.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
You know anything about the stations here?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Do you carry door handles?
Fungus?
I don't think so.
When I was little, in church.
No, I don't.
I'm here.
Hello.
Wow!
What?
Older.
I'm twenty-eight
That's what you said before.
Premeditated murder.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Fifteen minutes?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
What?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Oh, no.
An album.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Come on back to bed.
Hi.
I'm Opal.
You go to school together?
He is to a lot of people.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Got me an audition tonight.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
That's what Tim said.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Looked like an interview to me.
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
I see.
Yeah.
How come you never talk?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Ready.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory.
Says the United States of America.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Where's it parked?
No.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Just wait one fucking minute.
Only on a much grander scale.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
What's the travelling arrangements?
Who?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
I see.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Three.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Give her a beer.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
All right, you get out of here, man!
Okay.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Where was that?
Where's Wilma?
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
How about another beer?
Get out of here!
Not here, Duff.
Why did you?
That's the way he is.
What d'you mean?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
What the hell could you do?
Day work.
You heard me!
There's nothing to say.
Okay.
Just get her drunk.
Like what?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
They all got families to support.
Great.
I said, she's in great shape.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Who is?!
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Hi.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
He's your son.
Omar, listen to me--
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Take this off.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
How's the villa's security?
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
What are you talking about?
The words?
Yeah. That was me.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
Where the hell have you been?
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
What about the mainframe's access code?
What?
I thought you already left.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Shit...
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Senorita Josie.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
George! What are you doing here?
Transitioned?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
A flack jacket.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Hey there.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Are you--scared?
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
But now you don't have to--
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
That is so sad --
Josie, you look Rufus.
By name.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
We followed your instructions.
No.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Where are you going?
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Help me with this thing!
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
You mean a shithead.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
Hi.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
All of them.
There's a Jesse on the phone.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
What?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
What's happening?
What?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
You need me, I'll be here all night.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
But nightmares are the common thread?
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
This is nice.
Sorry.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
You sound like Peter Pan.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Nancy...
Your dreams?
Who is he?
What about Kristen?
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
How do we get in?
What was that?
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Why is he after us?
I'm in.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Well, they can be.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Hi.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Yes.  Always have had.
Wow.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I haven't decided.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
The movie star?
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
That's nice.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Working with Leonardo.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
I agree.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Mr. Thacker?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Cappuccino as ordered.
Definitely no comment.
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
Can I help you?
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Which was?
Try 'Flintstone.'
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
And she's in your house.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
Yes, that is correct.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Yes, Mister Harding?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Yes, Billy?
Y-y-y-yes...
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Sorry to have bothered you.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Go on...
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Thank you, ma'am.
H-H-Hearts.
So long, kid.
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
M-M-M-Mack?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
Yeah, Mack?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Where ya goin', Mac?
What?
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I refuse!
Don't you have any clubs?
Hear what?
Who told you that?
Can you borrow me a dime?
Hit me!
Yeah, Mac?
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Oh, yeah?
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Oh, yeah...
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Tha's your problem.
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Is everything all right?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
You ol' fucker!
Of course not.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
What for?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
No.
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Good.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm a liberal!
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
But, Faith--
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
But Faith--
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Why?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
What?
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Tonight?
I'll look forward to it.
Really?
What looks good?
I don't believe in statistics.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
No.
No.
Is he gay?
Kate, is something the matter?
But it's July.
I have vacation time coming to me.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Now what do we do?
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
I just got a dial tone--
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
What?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Maybe I can change him.
So...
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Then don't.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Mmhmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
What happened?  What happened?
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.
Do you like pigeons?
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
And if you don't?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
What are you crying for?
I've been sittin' in the church.
What I did to Joey.
Edie.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Where you goin'?
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
You can!
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
Are you on the level, Father?
Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
You'll work.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
My favorite little cousin.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
Don't let them hear you.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
I am--It's our only chance.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
When!?
They are live ones?
Yes, Master.
Then why do you shake so?
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
He called the day he escaped.
Did you know that when you married him?
Ask him his name.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
You know how I felt about her.
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
You ever wear one of these?
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
And what happened to Carl?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
All right, but...
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Call and tell you.
I bet.  How much?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
A little.
If I could have a little more room.
How many was that?
That's funny.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I can go to the bar.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
You believe that?
So she did help you?
You getting serious on me now?
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
In the trunk?
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I know what you're talking about.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Foley?  That you?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
The flight?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
You're not?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Can I do what?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
You like to sit down?
It's beautiful.
He's about to.
Then they're not separated, are they?
"Hey, yourself."
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
You wave back?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
I told you, he isn't here.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
...the fuck is this...
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Do you always stutter?
Too late for apologies, Walker.
A m-missionary?
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
How's everything?
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Well sure, Colonel --
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
How often you fight like this?
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It must of been a convincing letter.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
What if the Japanese did invade?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
How do you like my hair?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
I don't get it.
Just what you underlined.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
But you love me don't you?
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Charlie! Am I dead?
I call this the staccato. 
Why wait?
Looking good out there.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
He's trying.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Oh, Charlie.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Did you study for the test?
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
For everyone.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Hi, Dad.
I closed my Christmas club.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Would you get that, dear?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm just happy to see you.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Don't eat the red ones.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Come on. You can't be serious.
What are you doing?
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
I came to say goodbye.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
I was building a doggy door.
What are you talking about?
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
I know, Mom.
Allright. Calm down.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
I'm not going to die.
I'm ready...
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
One week old.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Nine.
Big trouble.
They sabotaged me.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
One more thing, Your Honor...
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
What impressed you about him?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Thanks for coming by.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Do you need a break?
No.
Where's Dad?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
That's correct.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Probably since she was born.
Joe?
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Charles...
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
What do you see? Riddick?
Hey, who?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
S'matter?
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Didn't bite.
Let's just be sure.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
So you noticed too?
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
What, you're goin' off, too?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Owens!
You know who Muhammad was?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
What?
Which half?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
We crossed our own tracks.
Well, you got the big gauge.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Said "looks clear."
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
What are you doing there?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
He's trying to form words.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
She comes along too.
I told you not to bring the other one.
What is that?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Thats a lie!
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
No.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
Yes.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Taylor! Tell him.
He doesn't know.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Come on you can do better than that!
Fuck this shit!
Come on man!
...beautiful night.
I volunteered.
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
What are you talking about! 
Found it. Growing in a garden.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Right...
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
I'm supposing.
I haven't been invited.
Good evening, Miss.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
Bank?
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
I don't.
Certainly not to me.
Just who are you, anyway?
They know you here--know your name.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Couldn't be.
So have I.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
No.  I paid him off.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Beer or ale, Miss?
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Who told you I was married?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Where's you get it?
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
If I understand what you meant by that.
I don't want to talk.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
You asked for it.
Name it.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Got the information on you?
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
How would you know, Brandon?
What are you doing here?
Send that?
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
I'll know when I find it.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Was that about the right angle?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
It does.  May I go now? 
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
But you still think she's innocent.
Not too far, I hope.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You ought to know why.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
It's fine, thank you.
To Ann.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Shall we go?
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
I'm not sure I can face it.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Attributed?
Of course.
Are you going to have coffee?
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
Did she talk about me?
Ha ha...
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
That's enough of that.
What have you been up to?
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Darling Susan.
Oh no!
What have you got there?
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Where?
Once.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
I say when it's over!
I'm not FBI anymore.
You never were...
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
That's the point, isn't it?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
... so I started tailing him.
They're on their way to Maui.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I'm serious.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
What's goin' on?
Those are cold.
Tyler, put the gun down.
What do you mean?
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
What's that, General?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
Your uncle will like this.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Storage, I think.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Yes.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You looking' for some company?
The price just went up to ten.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
It pays.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Fine.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Do you plan everything?
And why do you say that?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Good morning.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Where'd you go?
No?  Why's that?
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
No.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
What if someone tries to steal it?
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
Business.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
You're packing.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Why?
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Yeah.
Who did you think?
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Will I like it?
What if they serve soup?
Are you looking for something in particular?
Get out!
You don't believe me?
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Catch your breath.
And what am I?
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I will never doubt again.
We'll never survive.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Did you say, "I do"?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
It's you.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Yeah. It's really good.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Because I can stop now if you want.
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
No.  To the pain.
Hah?
Sixty-five.
Humiliations galore!
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Yes.
I accept.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Bye-bye, boys.
Your grandfather's here.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
I'll wait in the hall ...
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Yes, it's quite possible.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Where would you like to eat?
What kind now, Leo?
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
What???
Liebkind, no!
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
We swear it!
Yes.  We would!
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
We make love?
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
I shall count the minutes.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Nietzche...
The Blue Max...
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
What?
How early?
Or arrived with her.
Cash.
And when she left, she never came back.
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
What's your interest?
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
A good reason, I suppose.
I hate tears. 
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
You've led a charmed life.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Arbogast said...
Let's go see Al Chambers.
This is the old highway.
Watch your tenses.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I have?
Thank you. Again.
I'd like to.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
I imagine so.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
You go out... with friends?
Why do you ask that?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Phoenix?
That's it. 
You slept here all night?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Recluse. Kinder word.
I'll get your bags.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Was that all?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
That's it. You get it quick.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
That called ... commanded ...
Yes.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
The body of Joan Gale!
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Fine, thanks.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
But I have some friends waiting.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Shall we unpack it?
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
I'm heading out of town.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
I've been dreaming about this.
I know, Mother.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
But Rose...
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
He did?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Five hundred rabbits?
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I don't know.
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
She's watching the car again?
No, Mother, he's lying...
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Why is it taking so long?
How could that be, son?
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Oh. Did you say something?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
Quarter of twelve.
Boys? You say to me boys?
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
How is she?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Got yourself up?
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Your baby?
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Illusions, Madam?
Oh, no, ma'am.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Rose, you don't have to.
I... I can explain...
You think it's that good?
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
What... ?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
I can work this.
No you can't.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
Relax.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Yeah.
What?
Dean Martin.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
Where have you been?
Pure horse.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Oh yeah?
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
You need a doctor.
Why the beach?
The gang's all here!
You see that?
They're... around.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
They are clear, my Master.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Here we go again.
Come on! Come on!
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
Oh!
He's my father.
I know, father.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Told you, did he?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
Uh huh.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Right!
Weiss.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
You did right.
You're OK by me.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
No no no, no no.
Oh no no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
Morning after?
D'you really wanna call?
I don't think I belong here.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
What?
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Is everything all right?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
No... I can't!
I can't go out.
It's not your house --
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Bob.
That's it? -- Completely?
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Yeah.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Mr. Balboa --
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, Kayo.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ya puttin' me on?
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Fifty years, huh.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
God bless ya, Rock.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Paulie.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
...Sure.
Maybe ya better forget it.
What's ya sister like to do?
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
...Tight.
Ya really like her?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Check the scrawl.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
What the hell's a freeway?
Surprised?
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Why didn't you tell me?
Hold on a second.
What the hell is that?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
I got him on loan from Disney.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Does this help?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
A challenge, on my life.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Am I like Such a fellow?
By my head here come the Capulets.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Farewell, my cuz.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Welcome.
[Within] Juliet!
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I take thee at thy word.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
And so did I.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Right.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Who the fuck are you?
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Hazard pay...
Nobody's saying they don't.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
I'm a patriate.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
I take it you still want the money...
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
What are you doing?
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
How did you know?
But first you have something to take care of?
He sees this differently, as you well know.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
What a surprise...
Same thing, isn't it?
What's the difference?
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Dark ops?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
They don't have the package.
What the fuck happened?
Right now?
Do we need anything else?
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
Let's get him out of here...
What of it?
I know.
What happened to it?
You sure?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
I don't know what you're -
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I can't do that.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
He killed her...he killed her...
What are you talking about?
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
How much?
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
What's that?
Yeah?  So?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
So do I.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
Uh, no...
Don't you have to be here?
Dwayne.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
I don't suppose you've seen her.
She's not his type.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
It was going to be a surprise!
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
I didn't say that.  You did.
Dwayne please calm down!
We're out of here.
You're never getting that much.
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
How much is that?
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
So tell me what you know.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Oh, you American?
You bring American money?
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Carter, get off that stage!
I'm sorry.
How you doin'?
Well, hurry up.
This is a very dangerous man.
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
Good at what?
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Who?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Excuse me?
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
Why did you help me?
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Mind your own business.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Let's go.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
We made it, man.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
Baby Duck?
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
You know what a phone booth is?!
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Good job.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
You want more?
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Good God, ya'll!
Which one?
This concrete?  This is still America.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
I could get promoted right out of here.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
What kind of assignment is that?
Shut up!
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
Nobody touches me.
Ambassador Han.
Hello.
Yes.
It's Griffin.
I still have work to do here.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Ahh.
You look awful.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
And what did you say?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
I'll get the dress.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
I already made an appointment for later today.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
I don't think that's why she ran.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Give me that!
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
I'll have the same.
Can you fix it?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
You humiliated me!
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Yes I do!
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
A little longer for me.
Reporter?
Why?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
What happened at the luau?
Maggie, it's just a joke...
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Is that all right with you?
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Happy New Year, darling.
You go.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
-- it was a betrayal.
What?
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
So I mailed your letter.
No, I know that part --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
I want my money.
Yes, I did.
Are his folks nice?
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
Magic.
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I don't know --
Hey, my plate is full.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
What is it?
You think so?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Jonah!
Thank Victoria for dinner.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
This conversation is finished.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Hi.
You look good.
He's ten.
You want 'em all arrested?
How goes it?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Are you sick, Mama?
Forget it.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
Be still ...
You mean you're ready to give up?
But honey ...
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
No ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
Yeah.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Who is it?
How the hell did we get this detail?
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
You're going to have to explain that one.
Was he the president?
What the hell is that?
I can't tell you.
Make me an offer.
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Just some buddies.
Cool it. We got business.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
I was trying to score some dope.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
What?!
What's on the other end of this thing?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Jackson?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
I heard.
Over three-hundred.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
But, sir...
What'd you say, Captain?
Uh, Captain...
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
I think you're right, Keith.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Trust me, you're the best.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Thank you, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Shit, sir.
How fast?
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
What's the profile?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Understanding the following rights...
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Yes.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
What does it say?
Wait a minute.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Why?
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
You like it?
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
What?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Goodnight.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
No, I read it on the message.
Busy?
So you're monumentally busy?
Would you hold this for me?
Keymaster?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Yeah.
You think so?
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Okay, bye.
Yeah?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Yeah.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
No.
No, really.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Lloyd.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Ooop, excuse me.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Give me my firebird keys!
Now you're back.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
Should I stay?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
He's important to my business.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
When?
You want these people.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
Yeah, okay.
It kind of looks that way.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
That'd be fine.
Yes.
I think it's too late.
Four hundred, four fifty -
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
I'll talk to you later.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
You're sure about this two person thing?
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Shit.
Where is everybody?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Why would you wanna do that?
You could start with an apology.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Why don't you ask them?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
Just for you, Sid.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
What are we looking for?
They're roomates.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
I don't play games.
Oh--a God complex
I have rehearsal.
Can I come with her?
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
You're not allowed to ask that.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
I hate scary movies.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
Can I help you?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
What did you know about your mother?
What does this have to do with Sid?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
What Rielly?
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Stop following me.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
What's your point?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
None.
Possibly.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
How'd you do?
It's on the table.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
What number is this?
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Sure...
So you better leave.
Where are you?
Come on. It'll be fun.
Now for the real question.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
So is Dewey your real name?
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Does mom know?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
What were you doing out here?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
About thirty seconds.
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't shoot. It's me.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
So what's his reason?
He came to make up.
You're crazy -- both of you.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
It's past seven.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Do you really think Billy did it?
And you believe it?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
You've made a good life for yourself...
Here he comes.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
This doesn't make any sense.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Did you read them?
Nothing.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Oh, that's all.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
Him?
How do you know all about this?
We're focusing.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
We need a warrant.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Anything... anything missing or different.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Crime of passion.
But Mose Harper said...
What, Ben?
No sir...pleasure.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
That's what I said.
And maybe you lie...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Because she's my...my...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Futterman?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Think she means for us to follow?
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
From the beginning...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
It wasn't much of a letter...
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Stop that!
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Do I look like it that much?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
NedI knowI know
Really?
Thank you, my lady!
What do you want, Kit?
You have the money?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Wait!  Will you desist!
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Nothing comes.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
So now you are free to love
Will it restore my gift?
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
I have a wonderful new play!
And his ears.
Who is she this time?!
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Will! Have you finished?
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
How goes it, Will?
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Good morrow, cousin."
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
"Out."
I liked the dog, for laughs.
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Your Majesty
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
"Ay me."
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I am.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
Oh--no, no!
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
My lady VIOLA.
Good morning, my lord!
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
What of her bosom?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
But what of Lord Wessex?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
You are on my ground.
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Serve.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
You think so?
So who's going to do it?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I just thought we should discuss it.
Is this necessary?
I want to talk now.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
What is this?
Security.
You're not eating.
Looking for you? Yes.
About the mail --
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
But there's no --
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's all?
Right.
Yes.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
You're right.
Now?
What are you doing?
No, Alex. It's, it's --
I don't want to. It's different.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
No, I don't.
No, no, it's different.
Oh, good.
And the money?
Where he can't get it?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Two hundred pounds?
It wasn't like that.
Here.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Eh --
I'm not sure --
I'm boring?
What guy?
No.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
Is it real?
Chicken salad.
Who?
Lester.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
My keys.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
I don't know.
It turned out to be cancer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
George --
I can see that.
What're you doing later?
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Hi.
You going to answer it?
Are you in love with her?
No shit.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Yeah...
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Right.
She is.
Right, that's right.
Yes, Buffums.
You going to tell him?
Whew.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
I just have to do one little thing.
Did you?
Look, either come in or stay out!
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
I don't know what gets into me.
We're friends.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- we are?
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
No, man.
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Wanda...
Yeah!
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you know better...
Call me!
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
Honey?
Maybe you don't even like children.
You've never even been around one.
What!
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah, baby...
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Egypt!
No, but I think they might.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Neither do I, baby.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Did you?
Did you?
Tonight?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
I wanna hear it from you!
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
What?
No.
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.
No you won't.
What do you mean?

That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Hi, Leonard.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Well, you know what I mean.
How much?
What?
What?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
Well, there was this one time --
That's right.
Is he an enemy?
Sort of.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- why?
-- I'll get in the back --
-- there's not much room --
Thank you.
You seem disappointed.
Do you have something against traveling?
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
No of course not.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Yes?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Yes, Dad.
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
Yes.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
No I ain't.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Jack...
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Mom?
Red Rum.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Where does he go?
Please...
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
I did?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Did you find anything?
Stay away from me!
Why?
Stop it!
Mr. Ullman?
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
For getting a divorce?
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Mom-!
Yeah.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
LET THY SPIRIT
Were you tempted?
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
You bastard!
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Good evening, Vincent.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Oh, girls.
Oh-huh.
What is it, Betty?
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
Hold on.
I know.  It's ancient.
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Hurry, Sister!
What a shame!
What?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Three years.  A rookie.
You have to help me
She won't?  Why not?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
I'm getting experience.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Clarence!
What?
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Run!  Take off!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
What's wrong with my life?
Really catching on.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
You're my Olympic event.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Hey, girls.
Really.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
Get her!
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Yes?
Is this like your old convent?
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Ice cream!
She's... she's a nun.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
He is a behemoth.
... Brom Bones...
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
It is sacrilege!
Very few, if any.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
What is that you wear?
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
We should not go much further in this murk.
True enough.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Small talk.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Are you so superstitious?
People have put their trust in you.
It was not butchery.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
I apologize if I worried you.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
What... what are you doing?
You... you are alive.
May I see my mother?
She did not do it... please listen...
I can't remember.
I like them french-fried potaters.
You got any money?
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Yeah.
What?
Please Doyle, don't.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
I hate you!
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
I did live there in the state hospital.
Yeah.
I reckon I feel all right.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
All right then.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
All right then.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Yes, I guess you are.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
I reckon.
Do they know about you?
Yeah.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Yes sir.
Signs?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Better make it charge. 
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Jesus, what happened to you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I'd love to.
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
What's the difference?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Are you closed?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
Slow down, huh?
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Did you ever go back to see her?
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
You don't give up, do you?
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
What's this?
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
A little. Not much.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
What's your offer?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
What are you talking about?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
So what's the time?
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Here and there. Around.
Yeah, that's right.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
And?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
I just did.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah, I picked it up.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
That's obvious.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
You don't believe in God anymore.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Robbed.  He was angry.
Yes.  Initially.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
You gonna climb that with one arm?
You must think I like losing.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Apparently.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
The same.
Are you absol...
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Why?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
What happened?
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
I'll say.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
You're right, Joe.
But suppose it doesn't?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
You don't see any blood?
As far away as possible.
DAPHNE?
Done what?
What are you doing?
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Blow where?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
You - you -
He's going to be ashore with you.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Have I got things to tell you!
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Security.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Are my seams straight?
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
What's the surprise?
I'm a what?
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Josephine -
I guess she's not in here.
I was it.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Please.  It won't happen again.
I forgive you.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
I don't like no witnesses.
Oh?
What's the job?
Because I got some plans -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
Well, here we are.
We understand.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Me?
Really?
Yeah.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
You are?
What's in Florida?
Would you mind terribly?
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Are you staying at the hotel?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
What theory?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
The most wonderful thing happened -
What?
Guess!
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
I am?
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
What thing?
Complete washout.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Would you do me a favor?
Thank you.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
I know.  Every time!
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
You and who else?
Spats Colombo.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
It was such a long time ago.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Um, just about everyone.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
So, whats your point?
Youre not even listening.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Hi. Hey.
What color are my shoes?
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
How did you know that was me?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
You have had girlfriends?
So, whyd you say yes to me?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Not yet...
I am now, sir.
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
What's his name?
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
You could? How?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
It was too dark, Daddy.
David Lee...
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
They gone to the field...
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Who's winning, Mama?
Did you see Daddy?
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Poor creature...
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
What's wrong, Nathan?
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
Come, I'll take you home.
Whatcha got there?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
Good mornin', Nathan.
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
What Cartman?!
Mph rm rmph!!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mph rmph rm!
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
What's the password?
Guess.
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Oh, brother.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
I am the dark master!
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Fight the power!
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Cool!
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
It can't be.
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
I'm sure you'll be all right.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Do you want some advice?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
I'm not going with you.
I'm about to blow the wall.
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
I'm going back for Taylor!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
The pin machine?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
La da da dalala...
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Think he bought it?
What's on your mind, Miles?
I'm sure you have Buzz.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
It's mine.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
The small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I do what I gotta do to survive.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Who's there!
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Fantastic! What talent.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Like this?
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
Whoa.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
Do I want you?
What's plan C?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
So why do you stay?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Very good, busyboy.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Fletcher, get away from there...
Fletcher!  Now!
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
Increase positive pressure!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Thank you, Colonel.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
From what?  What's with all the security?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
Wait a second --
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
They've left, keep watching!
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
So?  What's the problem?
Ladies and Gentlemen...
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
They switched us over.
To what?
What is that?
That's quite a secret.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
It never occurred to me.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
My gosh, Norman.
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Why should I go?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
The refridgerator.
You don't believe me.
Squids?
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
It's for motion sickness.
Parasolutrine?
It's an idea.
Beth --
What's wrong, Norman?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
He can't manifest.
That's when you went in the sphere.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
You hear that?
How's that?
Pussy.
I don't get it.
What are you looking for?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Why are you looking at me like that?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
C'mon, Norman.
Our answer.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
What are you still doing here?
You don't understand about the sphere.
Page 87 of what, Harry?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Did I?
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
What'd you say to him?
She told me what you said, Norman.
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
How are the others?
What report?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I know that.
You could put it that way.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
You mean I generate an energy field?
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
They use the Bogan Force.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Here come six more... grid two!
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
And you?
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
You rich kids... are all the same !
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Sir, no, sir.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
She's flying starships !
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
He's nothing like you.
Who cares ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Where'd it come from ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Best in the Fleet !
What do you think you're doing ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Let's go.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Uh, I don't know.
Hit your jets, sir !
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
Departure angle on viewer.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Granted.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Hello, Ilia.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
I quit.
You quit.
Why did you quit?
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
That's true.  You grow up here?
But, but but but...
That: in an act of...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Yes...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
What?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Gonna' be good as new.
It's for your finger.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Why?
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What's the scene...
Hi.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
No, that's true.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
How's your star?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
You'd do the newspaper right here.
Sleep well?
Not without a rolltop desk.
What is it all about?
What are you going to do?
What are they offering?
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Big day last night.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
How big is this horse?
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
What'll I do for fun?
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Are you all right...?
Her...
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
What...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
No, you're absolutely r...
<u>Bobby</u>...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I want you to hear this.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I like you, too.
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Yeah.
I know that...
What?
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
You show Claire these sketches?
I can't tell.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
You said <u>three</u>...?
What is the...?
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I...
My wife's going to have a baby.
I had a witness I would.
Who's White...?
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
I want to make a good film.
I can't.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
Hi!
What did you say to them...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
And we're glad to have you here...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
Bet you did.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Well, not exactly s...
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
This is my daddy's house --
The timing was off -- I need this light.
That's so weak.
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
Uh.  What is it?
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
There you are!
Rachel's job is she works.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Mommy's sick, guys.
So you're okay.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Where Ben?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Planning on getting --
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
See, I know that.
You're a cross-dresser.
Oh, my God.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Are we.
That's not wh...
You weren't passing 'em out.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
I needed some time away.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Don't ever say that.
You heard me: leave the table!
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
We're not ready!
What's an audience going to tell you?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
I can read it to you.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Again!
No, not really.
No.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I dunno...
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
But...you called.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
I believe it.
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Doubt it.
Prnceton.
He did?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
I'll lead.
What are we going to do!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What's that supposed to mean?
What do you think?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Because I'll be firing at them.
Enjoying the tour so far?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
So, what are we looking at White?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
What the hell is it, anyhow?
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
What does that mean?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Thank you, Admiral.
What's the meaning of this?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
I know nothing of the sort!
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Didn't they tell you?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Well, Mister President.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
You're damned right they are.
That about right?
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
Roger, maintain.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Shoot, Lothar.
Primary bomb is live.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
Recall what mistake?
What do you mean?
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Um-hm.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Hey!
No I quit.
A cloud.
A cloud?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
And your mom.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Good.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
She's dead.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Great.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Oh, you were in the band?
Shit.
So, then, you're, like, available?
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Thanks. See man?
You okay, man? You okay?
Hi.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Oh, yeah?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
It's a mistake to think that.
I know. It's okay.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
What?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Oh, shit.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
No.
Seven-twenty.
Please?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
How?
Mm-hm.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
So how's college?
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Get off my roof!
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Hey!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Oh, How'd she get back?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Don't do that.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
What?!
Holy shit.
You sure?
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Yeah, hold on.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Ammo?
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
They could kill you.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I didn't.
What teacher?
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
We're engaged.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
So do I.
Good.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Twenty-two.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
Her own movie theatre.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
It is not.  Get out.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Are you or aren't you?
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
They'll love it in Pomona.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Of course it is.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
It's getting kind of late --
Just a scene I cut out.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
"Mad about the boy."
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Where are my cigarettes?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
That's a lie!  They still want me!
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
This room has not been used for a long time.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Haven't got a thing.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
A Storm Dragon?
Eliminate her.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Let's talk about us, not her.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Just like that?
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
I did.
Finished your estimate?
I bet they do.
What an adorable hat.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Well...I guess I can't.
I've got things to do.
Theories?
Yes.
Superman will return it.
I can do that.
How'd you do that?
But what for?
Your hair looks the same.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
What is this place?
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you talkin' about?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him --
You look wonderful.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
I just can't stand this.
There's a lot of choices here.
Peanut butter and jelly.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Well...  Not quite like this.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Name?
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
Is this blackmail?
Anything.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Thanks.  Let's go
I didn't have my camera with me.
Ricky?  Where...what...
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Where's the light switch?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
We already have a super-tanker.
Yes! This time we got it right!
Hostages?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
I didn't think I wanted to.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Sleep well?
I'm sorry.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Does she know about it? She's in it!
What else is ballast for?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Why didn't you go before we left?
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
I asked the right question.
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
He flies as well, then . . .
So --  I hope you like it.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Who is this . . . Superman?
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
What shall we do now?
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
They make my eyes itch.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
An angle?
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Who?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
What's he going to say?
What's that?
What I need this for?
You are . . .
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
Lois isn't here?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mom...
Do you know where you're headed?
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
You're not the only one.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
You're happy, aren't you?
La de da da...
What do you suggest, my dear?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
What's your name, boy?
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
He will be odd, different.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Oh.
How much do you weigh?
Uh-huh.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
Ally Jones.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
What happened?
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
She's resting.  In her room.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Why not?
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
You've talked to Billy?
That's what he said, is it?
It's for the school bazaar.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
Isn't it a lovely day?
So do you like your new room?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's vermin again?
Yes.
So he was mean?
I don't want you to lie.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Crafts.
Don't you want to hear?
We do.
You can't come here.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
What time in the morning was this?
Before the actual accident?
Why were you scared?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Nothing.
But Charlene...
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
I don't think so.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
But...
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
Take a top coat.
I tried to reach you twice -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, I...
You going to work all day?
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
We should abort.
My God.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
No good.
Where we going?
Why?
We don't have much time.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
I love you.  I always will.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
I guess you admire musicians.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
What museum?
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You do shorthand and typing?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
What is this, Emmi?
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Yes, von der Null.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I have illegitimate children.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I don't understand what you mean.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
What?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
He did?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
Yes.
Yes, Chuck?
Alright!
You can't to that...
What's it to ya?
The what?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
I caught one, back there.
What?
Okay.  Talk some more.
Bag some Z's?
What's that?
I want it to be over for you.
He'll find us, won't he?
A girl.  You know.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Surrounded by living tissue.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
Send a unit.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
Now, look...
Did you play recently?
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
I'm sorry, about this...
Where are you going?
Don't even think about it.
There's a ladder here.
They'll love that.
That's classic.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
What are you doing here?
Is this you?
Well... the red bra.
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
Who is it?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
Who's responsible?!
They won't...
... what... ?
Shut up!
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
One brother, one sister.
About me?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Fun?
I'll call them, okay?
Who?
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
Yes.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
A game?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...
Is there a room key?
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
His behavior... ?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
What the fuck... ?!
Attractive...
You know you can.
That could have been worse.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
Yeah.
Nell!
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Are you working with her?
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
I, I just can't...
Eleanor, how was the drive?
All right...
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
What is that tune?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Why do you need a chain like that?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Why?
Like you.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
I'm sorry.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
How they goin', kid?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
What.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
I didn't expect anyone.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Boomerang.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
It's been a while.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Right.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
Get seven years, did you?
What'd your father do?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Fancy it?
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
So what's your beef, pal?
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
I don't know.
She's nice lookin'.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
Where is he, then?
Is he here?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
What.
Ann--
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
Hi, Mr Crane.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
Look, I'm no expert, but--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
Birdy--
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
She's a rare one.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
...Oh, Jesus.
Please, Ed.
Your place?
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Huh?
Just coffee.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
OK, how did you know?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
...So, uh, who should I--
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Yeah.
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
...How you today, Ed?
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Huh?
'Lo, Ed.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Hello!
Second chair.
Not an owner.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Fifteen... what's next?
Ippolito!  Get back here!
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
What happened?!
What does it say?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
What's going on?
We will.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
This room sucks.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Mbwun.
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
I don't understand.
You were going to be married.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
We have to try and draw it off!
How?
Where exactly?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What have we missed?
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Are we talking Emmies?
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Who are you?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
How can they have a child?
Sure she would.
Lauren, right?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
No...I, er.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
I told you I can't.
What exactly?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
I made macaroni.
I won't be here Sunday.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Poopy day?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Brought on by what?
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Do they know?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
And what's that?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed those men?
A plague?
-- You saw this experiment?
What's wrong, Scully?
Jesus, Mulder...
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Had you.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Something's not right...
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
I was until about an hour ago.
According to this tag.
It's like jelly.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I can't really talk right now.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Been where?
What are you doing?
Where'd they go?
Cold...
I can't go any farther.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
I have answers for you.
A virus?
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Miriam...
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
Yes mother.
I'll be fine.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
I heard Julia and John got married.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
You're kidding me.
Any psychiatric medication?
Agent Novak.
You're looking well.
That's a secret.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
No.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
He was Harry's driver?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Can I hear you?
When...what did you do?
Holly.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
Have you seen Calloway?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
...again.
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Oh, the usual things...
That's his headache.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
They're Harry's.
Joseph Harbin...
You can help us.
That's what we want to find out.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
I can't say that I have.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
A parrot bit me.
Bring him in.
This is where he vanished.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Be sensible, Martins.
...of Santa Fe."
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
The Roumanian?
You remember me? Upstairs...
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
Richard. Hi.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
I don't think so.
Why?
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
Incredible.
We lost our key.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
No one follows that midrash.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
You coming?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Disease? What disease?
You're not in school? What do you do?
Why no silencer?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Bigger and better.
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Even though his dick is so big?
Don't curse in front of it.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
That's a much easier game.
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
An investment banking house.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Notice? Like what...?
Why?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Listen to me....
Give me a reason not to.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
It was a nine millimeter.
Balint?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
How have things been going?
Who told you that?
Which one were you aiming at?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Not too fast.
Mrs. Moebius.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Are you an artist?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
It's Friday....
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Who's this?
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
We tested the new bomb.
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Does he know?
No.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What's happened??
Good afternoon.
Hello!
You know each other?
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
No.
Congratulations, Enzo.
Because you'd laugh.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Have the car painted.
What about the shoes?
It isn't lit yet.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
No.
Enzo?
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Who?
How do you know that?
I'm going back home.
So have I.  ... Hello?
I'm being a pain, huh?
And you?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Way past it.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
Why is he doing this?
So why the long face?
What do you want me to do?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Want to get a drink?
We do!
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
But we're not open on Sundays.
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Good looking?
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They don't say it to me.
Don't look at it!
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Oh, that's so interesting!
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
It could be a man.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
Go on foot.
Clo-Clo?
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
Yeah.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
What! You can't be --
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
Must it?
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Mr Lombard?
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What do you suggest?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
What about your friendly cop?
Have we done business before?
Where is the Austrian?
Ever seen him before?
Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Must I speak to you in French?
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need. 
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Maybe I dont.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
Trying to say something, Martin?
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
Three oclock.
An Austrian.
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
No...
I... How long have I been here?
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
O est pass ton salon?
Alors?
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Jeanne, stop it!
Yes...
I'll go.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
I don't know it.  I feel it.
Tell me...
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
I'm staying, Jean.
Sound the retreat...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
W-w-what are you doing?!
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
The English??
Praying.
And may I go to Mass?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
He's feeling wonderful.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
... as always, majesty...
Yes... they were.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Well...?  Shall we go?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
No... not like this...
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
But my voices... they promised me...
I... submit to Our Lord.
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
That's now what I meant...
No!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
God asked you to do something?
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I don't think so.
Yes, my lord.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Is that bad?
He never says his name.
Beautiful.
I want to be with him always...
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
I'm going to get a doctor.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
I'm on the run!
Believe me, they've picked him up.
It costs.
I've no money.
Who's recruiting?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
What's happening?
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
Someone died here. It's tapu.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Spoken words?
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
It's my mother's piano.
Hello, then.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
How much did ya lose?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
I'm busy, Floyd.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
What do ya want the others to get?
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
You know anything about him?
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Everything go all right?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
You move right along, don't ya.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
What's your next step, Nick?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
You've got to get your mind off this.
What are you talking about?
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're talking like a crazy person,
What is it? Has he found him?
Don't.  It's horrible.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
You know, we know each other.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Your father?
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
And he still wants to marry me!
You can take that out to the car.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Not a thing.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
What about Jorgensen?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
He telephoned me today.
No.
That's ridiculous.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Don't you remember....
That's my business.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
But what if you need more money?
But he has nothing to do with it!
All right - you didn't.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
What hit me?
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
Maybe I will.
He's just been for a walk.
Looks like a hold-up!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
It was his body that was buried there.
Huh?
I'm going to tell her.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Why not?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Who do you think did it?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Maybe she has.
I'm sorry...  but...
Home!
Who fired you?
What's in the other direction?
A casual one.
What?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
They shouldn't have been here.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
There's nothing we can do.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
What do you figure it to be?
Where'd they go?
What am I supposed to do?
You don't know that.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
At-at-at-at-at.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Oh, that's fun.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
She okay?
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
SAY IT!
What!?
I heard it click.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
Must be a compartment.
What?
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
What if he's not?
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want to die.
I pick that way.
And then shoot them.
What do we do?
I don't know!
...Wes...?
But...
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Australia.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
Yeah, you're funny.
Jaeger?
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
I think he wants something to drink.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Permant cortex bond.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
I haven't done anything.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
Who?  Who's leaving?
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Why are you so concerned?
What are you doing here?
I was lost.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
She's not there
Where did you get this?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Now wait just a fucking-
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
What?
Your partner?
Fuck factor?
Jesus...
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
T.J., what're you doing?
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
No!
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
No.
Umm.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Yes, Baron.
I would start with cocktails.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I've got to see you.
Otherwise I'll call the police
I know it!
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Now just a minute, Major--
No--no.
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Last year? It can't be that long.
Filiba ...
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Spanish passports?
Now, Lily--
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Yes.
Yes.
You like that statue?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
It's disgraceful!
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Together.
Talk? About me--about us?
So you think you can get me?
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Mariette!
<u>Adolph</u>?
I don't believe it!
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
I think you'd better go.
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
But you saw it here.
How much time?
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Don't drop it Rose.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Sure. Count me in.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You're crazy.
Is he your boyfriend?
Yes, exactly!
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
A mistake?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
This is horseshit.
You jump, I jump, right?
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
I'm sorry.
It's been 84 years...
Anya!
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Isn't she lovely?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
How about a little game later?
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
Nice lines--
How about giving me another coat?
You work too fast for me, young man.
This is Mr.--er--
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Tell me.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Well, I can't.
At seven-thirty?
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
But--
Don't let's talk about it.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Are you screwy?
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
That's too bad.
Sure.
What?
I thought I put you to bed.
I was never stiffer in my life.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Is this your gun?
Are you happy?
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
No--not much--excepting-- 
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
The country boy's about due.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
He's all right.
You leave the kid alone.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Why?
That's the truth--every single word!
He's certainly good-natured.
"Smooth's" the word.
Sure, Sis.
Telegrams.
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
I don't understand.
Come and get him.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
How you feeling, Doc?
Better.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Since when is faro a business?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Then what do I do?
What?
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
What?
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
I laugh sometimes
What about her?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Where do you get these questions?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
What'd you do that for?
I don't like it.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
It's too late -
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
- Four wheel drive?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Is that any way to say hello?
Is this another one of your games?
Do you feel better now?
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
Hey - the world is my office.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
They point, I shoot.
... Does this do anything?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
What?
What now? And don't give me some movie clich like 'trust me.'
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
And when might that be?
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
What do you make of all this?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
What about ID's?
Will the cruise set it off?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Junior spends time with his child.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I told her I would if she would give me time.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Hush.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
No, I'm too hot now.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
What's the problem here?
That's nice.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Did you have your child at home?
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
How are you?
Wow!  Cool!
Whadda ya think?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
We're almost there.
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
What's going on?
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Ha-ha!!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Something's screwy here.
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Oh, no!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Who is it this time?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
But you're Irish!
I like plaits.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
H'm?
How long has -
Everything is gone, now.
Juliet who?
Victoria -
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Me, too.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
I don't know.
Hi.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
...How old are you?
Live with your parents?
You do?  What else you do?
What are you doing?
Chill out --
Are you getting this on tape?
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
If I can.
What is it you want me to do?
My work keeps me young.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
I'll be right after you.
Because it's illegal.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
So, what's he like?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Oh, really?
It's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Clear?
Thanks, Mark.
Good luck, Spud.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Who wrote it?
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
We're two thousand short.
The Sick Boy method.
Excellent.
Your usual table, sir?
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Such as?
It's the great outdoors.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
I don't understand.
Captain?
I could use a shower.
Not General Korrd.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
What do you mean?
Yes, Captain?
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Is it possible?
Is what possible?
...mark two.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
No special conditions?

Borgus Frat.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Each man's pain is unique.
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Are you embezzling?
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
I don't get it.
Senior exec.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Dillinger?
For being on to Dillinger.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oh. Anything else?
For sure...
I'm your program?
This town's full o' live ones.
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Flynn!!
You're alive!
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Flynn... you can't... I
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Yes, MCP.
But-what if I can't...?
Wait...I need that...
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
You bitch.
Can you cover me for an hour?
I'm done.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
There's another guy, still in the car.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Put a tap on her phone.
Yeah, but for who?							*
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
My husband is a good man.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Hello, Harry.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
Not because you were attracted to him?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
What is it?
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
What's going on, Harry?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
What is it you want me to do?
You'll call me then?
Who is this woman?
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
The forager's back.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
I took a cab.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
That's a long time.
Four hundred bucks.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
At the movies?
That dazzling imagination.
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Yes.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
What?
You wanna get unhaunted?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Clarence sent a letter?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
You goin' out?
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
What's this acting class guy's name?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
In case of what?
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
No. No, you don't.
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
You were a cop.
I'm your son.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Uh-huh.
Where'd you come from?
Sure. No problem.
That Vietnam movie?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Do you live here?
Exactly room-mates.
Yes.
No.
Where's that?
What was the Jew-boy's name?
No, sir!
Well?
What's she doing?
Meaning...???
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
This is April, right?
No, 1995 is the past.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
"Never cry wolf!"
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
Mason???
The guy was a total fruitcake.
We need gas.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
You're sure?
You... you couldn't have heard me.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
What are you talking about???
It's private.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Uh, that message...me?
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
What...virus?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
No, thank you.
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
That a fact?
I think I've heard that before.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Can I help you, sir?
Where to?
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You want somethin'?
You own this place?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
I want my car.
Genuine Draft?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I got it.
It's nothing.  Really.
You're welcome, Grace.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Like you.
Like they're made of polyester.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Jake.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
From?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
If you want.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Give him the money.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
He was going to--
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Well, nothing.
Now what?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Someone will find me.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Why would I kill her?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
No.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
I'm not rambling.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
Do we shake hands?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
Liar.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
You're not talking sense.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Jesus!
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Thirty-thousand dollars.
I call the policia.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Hell no!
What do you want for free?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Yeah...
Would you?
I do.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Two-hundred.
What?
Open up!
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
I call the sheriff.
That's right on my way.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
What happens when you lose?
I didn't say it bothered me.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Like you.
I have an idea.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Nothing.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Yeah.
I'm sorry...
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
In <u>cash</u>?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Anywhere?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Which you don't have.
But, in particular?
Genuine Draft?
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
You didn't hear something?
I'll keep it in my office room.
I remember you.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
I don't know what you're asking?
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
I have to go now.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
No.
I know now.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
How so?
Why?
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
I fined 'em instead.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Free ones?
All week?
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Like I said, I...
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
She's passed on, Kid.
Three ways, I figured.
You're goin' back with him?
Well... I don't recollect.
You missed him? You didn't...?
He ain't killed.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Did... you... get... him?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
You ain't shot.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
He musta been movin' right along.
She gave me the evil eye.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
He hit you?
Beats the hell out of me.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Yeah.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Yeah?
Jack. What are you doing here?
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
Don't hurt me.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
You set up the line-up.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
We're on vacation.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
He didn't have my lawyer.
Give a guy a break, huh?
Then what?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because he was my friend.
Edie...
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Mr. Abraham...
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
And no one will know the truth.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Objection!
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Why is that?
She getting good care over there?
I read the hospital report on your client.
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Continental Casualty...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Yes.  Price...
What Hotel are you staying at?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
Why don't you get some rest?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
You, you don't under...
It's over!
You're pressuring yourself...
I have to talk to you.
Uh ...
...he's a good man...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Right.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
... fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I just saw her.
Mrs. Simmonds.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Dr. Towler...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
He won't talk.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Interesting business.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Nothing.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Hello?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Judy Barton.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
It's a place to live, that's all.
I want to know who you are.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
The color of your hair...
Come here.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
But why? Why here?
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
What are you going to do?
Why am I here? What happened?
No...
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Please drink your coffee.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
Some people prefer it.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Have you been here before?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
There's a name on the gravestone.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
To the church, I must go there.
Let me go! Let me go!!
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Could be.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Here you are.
Where?
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
How?
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
Don't even start.
I'm calling the ambulance.
I'm calling the police.
Bury her out in the desert.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
We can't do this.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Fuck you Boyd!
It has worked.
If anything ever happens to me...
She's not here.
No I don't.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
What kind of words?
Regarding what?
I don't know...
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Not a prayer.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Not true.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
We're goosed.
This is ridiculous.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
The wedding cake check?
Sent it.
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
I wouldn't know.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He's a moron.
Charles Moore for instants.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
Time out.
Do you love me?
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
I love you.
Nesting?
Go have fun. Not too much.
Where are you?
What okay?
Now?
Don't even.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
He kept saying he was protected.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I'm getting married...
I don't hear it.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
I guess.
That's a good one.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
A mutant species.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
That's our plan.
Are there many windows?
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Was that difficult to get?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
How much is that?
Fifteen yards.
She's mad.
Kill him.
Leave him alone.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
A black bull came.
He came in through the cupboard.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
I've seen worse.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
How do you kill it?
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
What happened when he was 17?
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Don't worry about it, all right?
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
That's why I'm asking.
Lindenmeyer?
How's your pulse?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
There you go  best seat in the house.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
...tonight...
What about it?
It's <u>producing</u>.
...twelve years.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
...can we see the Kitten...?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
Oh, Lord....
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
War's over, Pal. 
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
I have.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
What do you think would hold it off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Is that true?
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
...we get our hands on him?
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Keep Talking....
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
Jim Belushi...?
I'm just talking about the Hats.
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
Long's you git me back for the beans...
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Grand Marnier.
He's lying.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
...well, see him?
...gotta read my reports.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Then get out and close it behind you.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
...Got a 100 on me, you...
...Work okay?
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
I don't know anything!
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
How do you know?
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
What if I have a previous engagement?
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
I can't...and I won't.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
He did?
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
What?  Tony and China, together?
Oh that explains everything.
Well?
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Safety in numbers man.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
It's only two hours away.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
That's not true.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Do you really think so?
Fireball?
What does she look like?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think you influenced her?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Um...
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
This fence...it's so...
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
You must think I'm pathetic.
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
She never mentioned her father.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
...just so she could cut them off.
Stop.
Do we have to?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Well good.  So you're human.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
It's niiice.
Oh...
I think so
Does Norman know?
Hartford?
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
If she was dangerous before--
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
I don't know...
Not the focus.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Mmnph.
Unless you need me to come home...
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
"...for my father."
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you call about the Feurs?
What's going on, Claire?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
What are you doing?
What are you doing out here?
What?
Keep your voice down.
Stop...
...I'm positive this time...
I tried to break it off!
It's alright.
She's gone.
How can you be sure?
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Nothing.
:Well, they are.
There are two.
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
I under5tand.  All the same
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
What is it...?
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Michael...  Do what you can.
Made it...?
If that were true, I would not be here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
Harder...
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
All I meant was -
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Rowan...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Hey - you're bleeding.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You did that, didn't you...?
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Something's wrong with you.
BRIAN...
Yes it is...
I'm sorry?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
What did you do with her?
then why did you marry her -
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
You've killed but you're not a killer
Tell me how it happened...
STEPHANIE?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
What's wrong?
Yes...
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Just put it in my room
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
ANGEL...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
So far away? In Xenia?
You're late, bro!
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
You do know how to drive?
It's your car. These are all your cars.
That's me.
You mean they knew who I was?
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
If you could just sign right there.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
In what sense?
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Wow...you clean up nice.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
That's refreshingly deviant.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
But who would run the store?
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
People pay good money for that?
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
I've got that two o'clock in town.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Where's this coming from?
You didn't cuff her?
What did you do then?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
You are.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
How much?
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
Why can't you come...
You think that's wise?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
There's nothing for them to get.
Just like that?
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
That was about as grim as it gets.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Sandy... What's up?
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Always hoping.  Or this...
All that jumping and kicking.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
What way is that?
Well... that, too.
So... what happened?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Really?
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
This is Colonel Richards.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
That would be... the Mexican War?
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Hey...!
You left me to die, friend.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Why not?
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
You?
Did she ask about me?
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Want me to carry Elora?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Watch it!
Dada, what's a daikini?
Who are you!  Who are you!
No.
You must learn magic.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Oooh, this smells terrible.
I'm not going in there.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Ohhh, I hate this.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
John, why?...
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
No pistol. Ever.
Is it them?
Have you got your gun on now?
Who else knows?
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Now what's the problem?
But not a good tired.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
I can't.
Enjoying your reading?
You're so sure of that?
That's God's way!
Anybody know about this?
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Say again?
Wrong.
I don't know where he is.
Yes.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
He's not in this building.
Get back in there.
My son is out there!
No --
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
If she?
From now on you'll be history
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh --
Ahh!  Ah!
Yes, I'm ready now.
...her face is careworn.
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
No --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
We might.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
How about a hippopotamus?
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Where's Kansas?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
What?
He said his mouth.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Yeah.
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Here --   Come on.
Yeah. Me?
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
But I still want one.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
You new?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
What is it?
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
The inside man?
Who is it?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Im sorry.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
I cant stay here.
Then take me with you.
What are you talking about?
One... last... screw?
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Whats your business with Elektra King?
How appropriate.
No! Bond!
Perhaps this isnt the time...
This is the end.
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
Had a lot of blood in him.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Don't call me that.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Would you like me to stay?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Because --
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
His what?
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What was he doing?
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
I don't know their real names!
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Ever see one of these before?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Up yours.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
We're not after car thieves here.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Thanks.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
What are you?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
Where are we going?
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
What's that?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
What is it you intend to do to me?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
To find Rogue.
How?
You designed this yourself?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
What did she do to me?
If she held on any longer she could have.
Is it enough?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
What in God's name are you doing?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
And your passport?
Yes.
Darling!
What a strange fellow.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Well... we'll see.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Fron kon steen!
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
What?
Break that old man's violin.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I'm sure we will.
There.
Just putting up some tea.
Did you see anyone else down here?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Was he any good?
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
What?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
You'll be getting me sad next.
No, no!  That whole thing!
What did you find out?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
Come on, big fellow!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
And look at this, Doctor!
Me?  Sing?
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
I think so.
Just passing through the night.
And Elizabeth has hers.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
